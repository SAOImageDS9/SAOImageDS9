*  Name:
*     err_null.c

*  Purpose:
*     Implement the default "err" module.

*  Description:
*     This file implements the default "err" module for the AST
*     library. It is used to deliver error messages if no alternative
*     error delivery mechanism is provided.
*
*     To provide an alternative mechanism, re-implement the astPutErr
*     function defined within this module. You can then either link
*     your program against the resulting library, or you can register
*     the re-implemented astPutErr function at run-time using the
*     astSetPutErr function defined in file error.c.

*  Name:
*     astPutErr

*  Purpose:
*     Deliver an error message.

*  Type:
*     Protected function.

*  Synopsis:
*     #include "err.h"
*     void astPutErr( int status_value, const char *message )

*  Description:
*     This function delivers an error message and (optionally) an
*     accompanying status value to the user. It may be re-implemented
*     in order to deliver error messages in different ways, according
*     to the environment in which the AST library is being used.

*  Parameters:
*     status_value
*        The error status value.
*     message
*        A pointer to a null-terminated character string containing
*        the error message to be delivered. This should not contain
*        newline characters.

*  Notes:
*     - This function is documented as "protected" but, in fact, is
*     publicly accessible so that it may be re-implemented as
*     required.
