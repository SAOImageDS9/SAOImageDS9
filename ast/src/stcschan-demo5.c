/* Name:
      stcschan-demo5.c

   Purpose:
      A demonstration of the facilities provided by the AST library
      for reading STC metadata encoded using the STC-S linear string
      format.

   Description:
      This program reads two STC-S descriptions from two disk files, and
      writes a new STC-S description to standard output. The new STC-S
      covers the same region as the first STC-S, but expressed in the
      coordinate system of the second STC-S.

   Usage:
      % stcschan-demo5 <stcs-file1> <stcs-file2>

      <stcs-file1>: The path to the disk file containing the first STC-S
      description.

      <stcs-file2>: The path to the disk file containing the second STC-S
      description.

   Example:
      % stcschan-demo5 stcs-ex1.txt stcs-ex2.txt

   To compile and link:
      Assuming your starlink distribution is in "/star":

      % gcc -o stcschan-demo5 stcschan-demo5.c -L/star/lib \
            -I/star/include `ast_link`
