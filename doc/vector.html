<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The <B>vector</B> command creates an array of floating point values.  The vec-
       tor's components can be manipulated in three ways: through a Tcl  array
       variable, a Tcl command, or the C API.

<H2>INTRODUCTION</H2><PRE>
       A vector is an ordered set of real numbers.  The components of a vector
       are indexed by integers.

       Vectors are common data structures for many applications.  For example,
       a  graph  may  use  two vectors to represent the X-Y coordinates of the
       data plotted.  The graph will automatically be redrawn when the vectors
       are  updated or changed. By using vectors, you can separate data analy-
       sis from the graph widget.  This makes it easier, for example,  to  add
       data  transformations, such as splines.  It's possible to plot the same
       data to in multiple graphs, where each graph presents a different  view
       or scale of the data.

       You  could  try to use Tcl's associative arrays as vectors.  Tcl arrays
       are easy to use.  You can access individual elements randomly by speci-
       fying  the  index,  or  the set the entire array by providing a list of
       index and value pairs for each element.  The disadvantages of  associa-
       tive  arrays  as  vectors  lie in the fact they are implemented as hash
       tables.

       <B>o</B> There's no implied ordering to the associative arrays.  If  you  used
         vectors  for  plotting, you would want to insure the second component
         comes after the first, an so on.  This isn't  possible  since  arrays
         are actually hash tables.  For example, you can't get a range of val-
         ues between two indices.  Nor can you sort an array.

       <B>o</B> Arrays consume lots of memory when the  number  of  elements  becomes
         large  (tens of thousands).  This is because each element's index and
         value are stored as strings in the hash table.

       <B>o</B> The C programming interface is unwieldy.  Normally with vectors,  you
         would  like to view the Tcl array as you do a C array, as an array of
         floats or doubles.  But with hash tables, you must convert  both  the
         index  and  value to and from decimal strings, just to access an ele-
         ment in the array.  This makes it cumbersome to perform operations on
         the array as a whole.

       The  <B>vector</B>  command  tries to overcome these disadvantages while still
       0.0.  In addition, both a Tcl command and array variable, both named y,
       are created.  You can use either the command or variable  to  query  or
       modify components of the vector.  # Set the first value.  set <B>y(0)</B> 9.25
       puts "y has [y length] components" The array y can be used to  read  or
       set individual components of the vector.  Vector components are indexed
       from zero.  The array index must be a number less than  the  number  of
       components.  For example, it's an error if you try to set the 51st ele-
       ment of y.  # This is an error. The vector only has 50 components.  set
       <B>y(50)</B> 0.02 You can also specify a range of indices using a colon (:) to
       separate the first and last indices of the range.  # Set the first  six
       components  of y set y(0:5) 25.2 If you don't include an index, then it
       will default to the first and/or last component of the vector.  # Print
       out  all  the  components  of y puts "y = $y(:)" There are special non-
       numeric indices.  The index end, specifies the last  component  of  the
       vector.  It's an error to use this index if the vector is empty (length
       is zero).  The index ++end can be used to extend the vector by one com-
       ponent  and initialize it to a specific value.  You can't read from the
       array using this index, though.  # Extend the vector by one  component.
       set  y(++end)  0.02  The  other  special indices are min and max.  They
       return the current smallest and largest components of  the  vector.   #
       Print the bounds of the vector puts "min=$y(min) max=$y(max)" To delete
       components from a vector, simply unset the corresponding array element.
       In the following example, the first component of y is deleted.  All the
       remaining components of y will be moved down by one index as the length
       of  the  vector  is reduced by one.  # Delete the first component unset
       <B>y(0)</B> puts "new first element is $<B>y(0)</B>" The  vector's  Tcl  command  can
       also  be  used to query or set the vector.  # Create and set the compo-
       nents of a new vector blt::vector create x x set { 0.02 0.04 0.06  0.08
       0.10 0.12 0.14 0.16 0.18 0.20 } Here we've created a vector x without a
       initial length specification.  In this case, the length is  zero.   The
       <B>set</B>  operation  resets  the vector, extending it and setting values for
       each new component.

       There are several operations for vectors.  The  <B>range</B>  operation  lists
       the  components of a vector between two indices.  # List the components
       puts "x = [x range 0 end]" You can search for a particular value  using
       the  <B>search</B>  operation.  It returns a list of indices of the components
       with the same value.  If no component has the same  value,  it  returns
       "".   #  Find  the index of the biggest component set indices [x search
       $x(max)] Other operations copy,  append,  or  sort  vectors.   You  can
       append  vectors  or  new values onto an existing vector with the <B>append</B>
       operation.  # Append assorted vectors and values to x x append x2 x3  {
       2.3  4.5  }  x4 The <B>sort</B> operation sorts the vector.  If any additional
       vectors are specified, they are rearranged in the  same  order  as  the
       vector.   For example, you could use it to sort data points represented
       by x and y vectors.  # Sort the data points x sort y The  vector  x  is
       sorted  while  the  components of y are rearranged so that the original
       x,y coordinate pairs are retained.

       The <B>expr</B> operation lets you perform arithmetic on vectors.  The  result
       is stored in the vector.  # Add the two vectors and a scalar x expr { x
       + y } x expr { x * 2 } When a vector is modified, resized, or  deleted,
       Vectors are created using the <B>vector</B> <B>create</B> operation.  Th <B>create</B> oper-
       ation can be invoked in one of three forms:

       <B>blt::vector</B> <B>create</B> <I>vecName</I>
              This  creates a new vector <I>vecName</I> which initially has no compo-
              nents.

       <B>blt::vector</B> <B>create</B> <I>vecName</I>(<I>size</I>)
              This second form creates a new vector which  will  contain  <I>size</I>
              number  of  components.  The components will be indexed starting
              from zero (0). The default value for the components is 0.0.

       <B>blt::vector</B> <B>create</B> <I>vecName</I>(<I>first</I>:<I>last</I>)
              The last form creates a new  vector  of  indexed  <I>first</I>  through
              <I>last</I>.   <I>First</I> and <I>last</I> can be any integer value so long as <I>first</I>
              is less than <I>last</I>.

       Vector names must start with a letter and consist of  letters,  digits,
       or  underscores.   #  Error:  must start with letter blt::vector create
       1abc You can automatically generate vector names using the "#auto" vec-
       tor  name.   The  <B>create</B>  operation will generate a unique vector name.
       set vec [blt::vector create #auto] puts "$vec has [$vec length]  compo-
       nents"

   <B>VECTOR</B> <B>INDICES</B>
       Vectors  are indexed by integers.  You can access the individual vector
       components via its array variable or Tcl command.   The  string  repre-
       senting  the index can be an integer, a numeric expression, a range, or
       a special keyword.

       The index must lie within the current range of the vector, otherwise an
       an  error  message  is  returned.  Normally the indices of a vector are
       start from 0.  But you can use the <B>offset</B> operation to  change  a  vec-
       tor's  indices  on-the-fly.   puts  $<B>vecName(0)</B>  vecName offset -5 puts
       $vecName(-5) You can also use  numeric  expressions  as  indices.   The
       result  of  the expression must be an integer value.  set n 21 set vec-
       Name($n+3) 50.2 The following special non-numeric  indices  are  avail-
       able:  min,  max, end, and ++end.  puts "min = $vecName($min)" set vec-
       Name(end) -1.2 The indices min and max will return the minimum and max-
       imum values of the vector.  The index end returns the value of the last
       component in the vector.  The index ++end is used to append  new  value
       onto  the vector.  It automatically extends the vector by one component
       and sets its value.  # Append an new component  to  the  end  set  vec-
       Name(++end)  3.2 A range of indices can be indicated by a colon (:).  #
       Set the first six components to 1.0 set vecName(0:5) 1.0 If no index is
       supplied the first or last component is assumed.  # Print the values of
       all the components puts $vecName(:)

       <B>blt::vector</B> <B>create</B> <I>vecName</I>?(<I>size</I>)?... ?<I>switches</I>?
              The <B>create</B> operation creates a new vector <I>vecName</I>.  Both  a  Tcl
              command  and  array variable <I>vecName</I> are also created.  The name
                     then  no  variable  will be mapped.  You can always map a
                     variable back to the vector using the  vector's  <B>variable</B>
                     operation.

              <B>-command</B> <I>cmdName</I>
                     Maps  a  Tcl  command  to  the  vector. The vector can be
                     accessed using <I>cmdName</I> and one  of  the  vector  instance
                     operations.   A  Tcl  command by that name cannot already
                     exist.  If <I>cmdName</I> is the empty string, no  command  map-
                     ping will be made.

              <B>-watchunset</B> <I>boolean</I>
                     Indicates  that  the  vector  should automatically delete
                     itself if the variable  associated  with  the  vector  is
                     unset.  By default, the vector will not be deleted.  This
                     is different from  previous  releases.   Set  <I>boolean</I>  to
                     "true" to get the old behavior.

       <B>blt::vector</B> <B>destroy</B> <I>vecName</I> ?<I>vecName...</I>?
              Deletes  one  or  more  vectors.  Both the Tcl command and array
              variable are removed also.

       <B>blt::vector</B> <B>expr</B> <I>expression</I>
              All binary operators take vectors  as  operands  (remember  that
              numbers are treated as one-component vectors).  The exact action
              of binary operators depends upon the length of the second  oper-
              and.   If  the  second operand has only one component, then each
              element of the first vector operand is computed by  that  value.
              For  example,  the  expression "x * 2" multiples all elements of
              the vector x by 2.  If the second operand has more than one com-
              ponent,  both  operands  must  be the same length.  Each pair of
              corresponding elements are computed.  So "x + y"  adds  the  the
              first components of x and y together, the second, and so on.

              The  valid  operators  are  listed  below, grouped in decreasing
              order of precedence:

              <B>-</B>  <B>!</B>                Unary minus  and  logical  NOT.   The  unary
                                  minus  flips  the  sign of each component in
                                  the  vector.   The  logical   not   operator
                                  returns  a vector of whose values are 0.0 or
                                  1.0.  For each  non-zero  component  1.0  is
                                  returned, 0.0 otherwise.

              <B>^</B>                   Exponentiation.

              <B>*</B>  <B>/</B>  <B>%</B>             Multiply, divide, remainder.

              <B>+</B>  <B>-</B>                Add and subtract.

              <B>&lt;&lt;</B>  <B>&gt;&gt;</B>              Left and right shift.  Circularly shifts the
                                  values of the vector (not implemented  yet).

              <B>&amp;&amp;</B>                  Logical AND.  Produces a 1  result  if  both
                                  operands are non-zero, 0 otherwise.

              <B>||</B>                  Logical OR.  Produces a 0 result if both op-
                                  erands are zero, 1 otherwise.

              <I>x</I><B>?</B><I>y</I><B>:</B><I>z</I>               If-then-else, as  in  C.   (Not  implemented
                                  yet).

              See  the  C  manual  for more details on the results produced by
              each operator.  All of the binary operators group  left-to-right
              within the same precedence level.

              Several  mathematical functions are supported for vectors.  Each
              of the following functions invokes the math library function  of
              the  same name; see the manual entries for the library functions
              for details on what they do.  The operation is  applied  to  all
              elements     of    the    vector    returning    the    results.
              <B>acos</B>    <B>cos</B>     <B>hypot</B>   <B>sinh</B>        <B>asin</B>    <B>cosh</B>    <B>log</B>     <B>sqrt</B>
              <B>atan</B>    <B>exp</B>     <B>log10</B>   <B>tan</B> <B>ceil</B>    <B>floor</B>   <B>sin</B>     <B>tanh</B>

              Additional functions are:

              <B>abs</B>       Returns the absolute value of each component.

              <B>random</B>    Returns a vector of non-negative values uniformly dis-
                        tributed between [0.0, 1.0) using <I>drand48</I>.   The  seed
                        comes from the internal clock of the machine or may be
                        set manual with the srandom function.

              <B>round</B>     Rounds each component of the vector.

              <B>srandom</B>   Initializes the random number generator using <I>srand48</I>.
                        The high order 32-bits are set using the integral por-
                        tion of the first vector component. All  other  compo-
                        nents  are  ignored.  The low order 16-bits are set to
                        an arbitrary value.

              The following functions return a single value.

              <B>adev</B>      Returns the average deviation (defined as the  sum  of
                        the  absolute values of the differences between compo-
                        nent and the mean, divided by the length of  the  vec-
                        tor).

              <B>kurtosis</B>  Returns  the  degree  of peakedness (fourth moment) of
                        the vector.

              <B>length</B>    Returns the number of components in the vector.

              <B>max</B>       Returns the vector's maximum value.


              <B>skew</B>      Returns  the skewness (or third moment) of the vector.
                        This characterizes the degree of asymmetry of the vec-
                        tor about the mean.

              <B>sum</B>       Returns the sum of the components.

              <B>var</B>       Returns  the  variance  of  the vector. The sum of the
                        squared differences between  each  component  and  the
                        mean  is computed.  The variance is the sum divided by
                        the length of the vector minus 1.

              The last set returns a vector of the same length  as  the  argu-
              ment.

              <B>norm</B>      Scales  the  values  of the vector to lie in the range
                        [0.0..1.0].

              <B>sort</B>      Returns the  vector  components  sorted  in  ascending
                        order.

<H2>INSTANCE OPERATIONS</H2><PRE>
       You  can  also use the vector's Tcl command to query or modify it.  The
       general form is <I>vecName</I> <I>operation</I>  ?<I>arg</I>?...   Both  <I>operation</I>  and  its
       arguments  determine the exact behavior of the command.  The operations
       available for vectors are listed below.

       <I>vecName</I> <B>append</B> <I>item</I> ?<I>item</I>?...
              Appends the component values from <I>item</I> to <I>vecName</I>.  <I>Item</I> can  be
              either the name of a vector or a list of numeric values.

       <I>vecName</I> <B>binread</B> <I>channel</I> ?<I>length</I>? ?<I>switches</I>?
              Reads  binary  values  from  a  Tcl  channel.  Values are either
              appended to the end of the vector or placed  at  a  given  index
              (using  the  <B>-at</B>  option), overwriting existing values.  Data is
              read until EOF is found on the channel or a specified number  of
              values  <I>length</I>  are  read (note that this is not necessarily the
              same as the number of bytes). The following  switches  are  sup-
              ported:

              <B>-swap</B>  Swap  bytes  and  words.   The default endian is the host
                     machine.

              <B>-at</B> <I>index</I>
                     New values will start at vector index <I>index</I>.   This  will
                     overwrite any current values.

              <B>-format</B> <I>format</I>
                     Specifies  the  format of the data.  <I>Format</I> can be one of
                     the following: "i1", "i2", "i4", "i8", "u1,  "u2",  "u4",

              This is useful when the vector is large.

       <I>vecName</I> <B>delete</B> <I>index</I> ?<I>index</I>?...
              Deletes the <I>index</I>th component from the vector <I>vecName</I>.  <I>Index</I> is
              the  index  of  the  element to be deleted.  This is the same as
              unsetting the array variable element <I>index</I>.  The vector is  com-
              pacted after all the indices have been deleted.

       <I>vecName</I> <B>dup</B> <I>destName</I>
              Copies  <I>vecName</I>  to <I>destName</I>. <I>DestName</I> is the name of a destina-
              tion vector.  If a vector <I>destName</I> already exists, it  is  over-
              written  with the components of <I>vecName</I>.  Otherwise a new vector
              is created.

       <I>vecName</I> <B>expr</B> <I>expression</I>
              Computes the expression and resets  the  values  of  the  vector
              accordingly.    Both  scalar  and  vector  math  operations  are
              allowed.  All values in expressions are either real  numbers  or
              names of vectors.  All numbers are treated as one component vec-
              tors.

       <I>vecName</I> <B>length</B> ?<I>newSize</I>?
              Queries or resets the number of components in <I>vecName</I>.   <I>NewSize</I>
              is  a  number specifying the new size of the vector.  If <I>newSize</I>
              is smaller than the current size of <I>vecName</I>,  <I>vecName</I>  is  trun-
              cated.   If  <I>newSize</I>  is greater, the vector is extended and the
              new components are initialized to 0.0.  If no  <I>newSize</I>  argument
              is present, the current length of the vector is returned.

       <I>vecName</I> <B>merge</B> <I>srcName</I> ?<I>srcName</I>?...
              Merges  the  named  vectors into a single vector.  The resulting
              vector is formed by merging the components of each source vector
              one index at a time.

       <I>vecName</I> <B>notify</B> <I>keyword</I>
              Controls  how vector clients are notified of changes to the vec-
              tor.  The exact behavior is determined by <I>keyword</I>.

              always Indicates that clients are  to  be  notified  immediately
                     whenever the vector is updated.

              never  Indicates that no clients are to be notified.

              whenidle
                     Indicates  that  clients  are  to be notified at the next
                     idle point whenever the vector is updated.

              now    If any client notifications is  currently  pending,  they
                     are notified immediately.

              cancel Cancels  pending  notifications of clients using the vec-
                     tor.

              <I>density</I> number of new components, whose values are  evenly  dis-
              tributed between the original components values.  This is useful
              for generating abscissas to be interpolated along a spline.

       <I>vecName</I> <B>range</B> <I>firstIndex</I> ?<I>lastIndex</I>?...
              Returns a list of numeric values representing the vector  compo-
              nents  between  two  indices.  Both <I>firstIndex</I> and <I>lastIndex</I> are
              indices representing the range of components to be returned.  If
              <I>lastIndex</I>  is less than <I>firstIndex</I>, the components are listed in
              reverse order.

       <I>vecName</I> <B>search</B> <I>value</I> ?<I>value</I>?
              Searches for a value or range of values among the components  of
              <I>vecName</I>.   If  one <I>value</I> argument is given, a list of indices of
              the components which equal <I>value</I> is returned.  If a second <I>value</I>
              is  also  provided, then the indices of all components which lie
              within the range of the two values are returned.  If  no  compo-
              nents are found, then "" is returned.

       <I>vecName</I> <B>set</B> <I>item</I>
              Resets  the components of the vector to <I>item</I>. <I>Item</I> can be either
              a list of numeric expressions or another vector.

       <I>vecName</I> <B>seq</B> <I>start</I> ?<I>finish</I>? ?<I>step</I>?
              Generates a sequence of values starting with  the  value  <I>start</I>.
              <I>Finish</I>  indicates  the  terminating  value of the sequence.  The
              vector is automatically resized to contain  just  the  sequence.
              If three arguments are present, <I>step</I> designates the interval.

              With  only two arguments (no <I>finish</I> argument), the sequence will
              continue until the vector is filled.   With  one  argument,  the
              interval defaults to 1.0.

       <I>vecName</I> <B>sort</B> ?<B>-reverse</B>? ?<I>argName</I>?...
              Sorts  the  vector <I>vecName</I> in increasing order.  If the <B>-reverse</B>
              flag is present, the vector is sorted in decreasing  order.   If
              other  arguments <I>argName</I> are present, they are the names of vec-
              tors which will be rearranged in the  same  manner  as  <I>vecName</I>.
              Each  vector  must be the same length as <I>vecName</I>.  You could use
              this to sort the x vector of a graph, while still retaining  the
              same x,y coordinate pairs in a y vector.

       <I>vecName</I> <B>variable</B> <I>varName</I>
              Maps  a  Tcl  variable to the vector, creating another means for
              accessing the vector.  The variable <I>varName</I> can't already exist.
              This overrides any current variable mapping the vector may have.


</PRE>
<H2>C LANGUAGE API</H2><PRE>
       You can create, modify, and destroy vectors from C code, using  library
       routines.   You  need to include the header file blt.h. It contains the
       definition of the structure <B>Blt_Vector</B>, which  represents  the  vector.
       It appears below.  typedef struct {
       <B>Blt_CreateVector</B>

                      tor **<I>vecPtrPtr</I>;

         Description:
                   Creates a new vector  <I>vecName</I>  with  a  length  of  <I>length</I>.
                   <B>Blt_CreateVector</B>  creates  both a new Tcl command and array
                   variable <I>vecName</I>.  Neither a  command  nor  variable  named
                   <I>vecName</I>  can  already  exist.   A  pointer to the vector is
                   placed into <I>vecPtrPtr</I>.

         Results:  Returns TCL_OK if the vector is successfully  created.   If
                   <I>length</I>  is  negative,  a  Tcl  variable  or command <I>vecName</I>
                   already exists, or memory cannot be allocated for the  vec-
                   tor,  then  TCL_ERROR  is  returned and <I>interp-&gt;result</I> will
                   contain an error message.

                      Tcl_Interp *<I>interp</I>; char *<I>vecName</I>;

         Description:
                   Removes the vector <I>vecName</I>.  <I>VecName</I> is the name of a  vec-
                   tor  which  must  already  exist.  Both the Tcl command and
                   array variable <I>vecName</I> are destroyed.  All clients  of  the
                   vector  will  be  notified  immediately that the vector has
                   been destroyed.

         Results:  Returns TCL_OK if the vector is successfully  deleted.   If
                   <I>vecName</I>  is  not  the  name  a  vector,  then  TCL_ERROR is
                   returned and <I>interp-&gt;result</I> will contain an error  message.


       <B>Blt_DeleteVector</B>

                      Blt_Vector *<I>vecPtr</I>;

         Description:
                   Removes  the  vector  pointed  to  by  <I>vecPtr</I>.  <I>VecPtr</I> is a
                   pointer to a vector,  typically  set  by  <B>Blt_GetVector</B>  or
                   <B>Blt_CreateVector</B>.   Both the Tcl command and array variable
                   of the vector are destroyed.  All  clients  of  the  vector
                   will  be  notified  immediately  that  the  vector has been
                   destroyed.

         Results:  Returns TCL_OK if the vector is successfully  deleted.   If
                   <I>vecName</I>  is  not  the  name  a  vector,  then  TCL_ERROR is

         Results:  Returns TCL_OK if the vector is successfully retrieved.  If
                   <I>vecName</I>  is  not  the  name  of a vector, then TCL_ERROR is
                   returned and <I>interp-&gt;result</I> will contain an error  message.


       <B>Blt_ResetVector</B>


         Synopsis: int  <B>Blt_ResetVector</B>  (<I>vecPtr</I>,  <I>dataArr</I>,         <I>numValues</I>,
                   <I>arraySize</I>, <I>freeProc</I>)
                      Blt_Vector *<I>vecPtr</I>; double *<I>dataArr</I>; int *<I>numValues</I>; int
                      *<I>arraySize</I>; Tcl_FreeProc *<I>freeProc</I>;

         Description:
                   Resets  the  components of the vector pointed to by <I>vecPtr</I>.
                   Calling <B>Blt_ResetVector</B> will trigger the vector to dispatch
                   notifications  to its clients. <I>DataArr</I> is the array of dou-
                   bles which represents the vector  data.  <I>NumValues</I>  is  the
                   number  of  elements  in the array. <I>ArraySize</I> is the actual
                   size of the array (the array may be bigger than the  number
                   of values stored in it). <I>FreeProc</I> indicates how the storage
                   for the vector component array (<I>dataArr</I>) was allocated.  It
                   is used to determine how to reallocate memory when the vec-
                   tor is resized  or  destroyed.   It  must  be  TCL_DYNAMIC,
                   TCL_STATIC,  TCL_VOLATILE,  or  a  pointer to a function to
                   free the memory allocated for the vector array. If <I>freeProc</I>
                   is  TCL_VOLATILE,  it indicates that <I>dataArr</I> must be copied
                   and saved.  If <I>freeProc</I> is TCL_DYNAMIC, it  indicates  that
                   <I>dataArr</I>  was dynamically allocated and that Tcl should free
                   <I>dataArr</I> if necessary.  Static indicates that nothing should
                   be done to release storage for <I>dataArr</I>.

         Results:  Returns  TCL_OK  if the vector is successfully resized.  If
                   <I>newSize</I> is negative, a vector <I>vecName</I> does  not  exist,  or
                   memory  cannot  be allocated for the vector, then TCL_ERROR
                   is returned and <I>interp-&gt;result</I> will contain an  error  mes-
                   sage.


       <B>Blt_ResizeVector</B>

         Synopsis: int <B>Blt_ResizeVector</B> (<I>vecPtr</I>, <I>newSize</I>)
                      Blt_Vector *<I>vecPtr</I>; int <I>newSize</I>;

         Description:
                   Resets  the  length  of  the vector pointed to by <I>vecPtr</I> to
                   <I>newSize</I>.  If <I>newSize</I> is smaller than the  current  size  of
                   the  vector,  it  is truncated.  If <I>newSize</I> is greater, the
                   vector is extended and the new components  are  initialized
                   to 0.0.  Calling <B>Blt_ResetVector</B> will trigger the vector to
                   dispatch notifications.

            Results:  Returns 1 if a vector <I>vecName</I> exists and 0 otherwise.


         If  your  application  needs to be notified when a vector changes, it
         can allocate a unique <I>client</I> <I>identifier</I> for itself.  Using this iden-
         tifier,  you  can  then  register a call-back to be made whenever the
         vector is updated or destroyed.  By default, the call-backs are  made
         at the next idle point.  This can be changed to occur at the time the
         vector is modified.  An application can allocate more than one  iden-
         tifier  for any vector.  When the client application is done with the
         vector, it should free the identifier.

         The call-back routine must of the following type.

                typedef void (<B>Blt_VectorChangedProc</B>) (Tcl_Interp *<I>interp</I>,
                   ClientData <I>clientData</I>, Blt_VectorNotify <I>notify</I>);

         <I>ClientData</I> is passed to this routine whenever it is called.  You  can
         use  this  to pass information to the call-back.  The <I>notify</I> argument
         indicates whether the vector has been updated of destroyed. It is  an
         enumerated type.

                typedef enum {
                    BLT_VECTOR_NOTIFY_UPDATE=1,
                    BLT_VECTOR_NOTIFY_DESTROY=2 } <B>Blt_VectorNotify</B>;


         <B>Blt_AllocVectorId</B>

            Synopsis: Blt_VectorId <B>Blt_AllocVectorId</B> (<I>interp</I>, <I>vecName</I>)
                        Tcl_Interp *<I>interp</I>; char *<I>vecName</I>;

            Description:
                      Allocates  an client identifier for with the vector <I>vec-</I>
                      <I>Name</I>.  This identifier can be used to  specify  a  call-
                      back  which  is  triggered when the vector is updated or
                      destroyed.

            Results:  Returns a client identifier if successful.   If  <I>vecName</I>
                      is  not  the name of a vector, then NULL is returned and
                      <I>interp-&gt;result</I> will contain an error message.

                        **<I>vecPtrPtr</I>;

            Description:
                      Retrieves  the  vector  used by <I>clientId</I>.  <I>ClientId</I> is a
                      valid   vector   client    identifier    allocated    by
                      Specifies  a call-back routine to be called whenever the
                      vector associated with <I>clientId</I> is updated  or  deleted.
                      <I>Proc</I>  is  a  pointer to call-back routine and must be of
                      the type <B>Blt_VectorChangedProc</B>.  <I>ClientData</I>  is  a  one-
                      word  value  to  be  passed  to  the  routine when it is
                      invoked. If <I>proc</I> is NULL, then the client is  not  noti-
                      fied.

            Results:  The  designated call-back procedure will be invoked when
                      the vector is updated or destroyed.

                        Blt_VectorId <I>clientId</I>;

            Description:
                      Frees the client identifier.  Memory allocated  for  the
                      identifier  is  released.   The client will no longer be
                      notified when the vector is modified.

            Results:  The designated call-back procedure will be no longer  be
                      invoked when the vector is updated or destroyed.

                      client identifier <I>clientId</I>.

            Results:  Returns the name of the vector associated with <I>clientId</I>.
                      If  <I>clientId</I> is not an identifier or the vector has been
                      destroyed, NULL is returned.

            Synopsis: void <B>Blt_InstallIndexProc</B> (<I>indexName</I>, <I>procPtr</I>)
                        char *<I>indexName</I>; Blt_VectorIndexProc *<I>procPtr</I>;

            Description:
                      Registers a function to be called to retrieved the index
                      <I>indexName</I> from the vector's array variable.

                      typedef double Blt_VectorIndexProc(Vector *vecPtr);

                      The  function  will  be  passed a pointer to the vector.

       reset  shortly.  The  vector  is updated when <B>lt_ResetVector</B> is called.
       Blt_ResetVector makes the changes visible  to  the  Tcl  interface  and
       other vector clients (such as a graph widget).

       #include  &lt;tcl.h&gt;  #include  &lt;blt.h&gt;         Blt_Vector *vecPtr; double
       *newArr; FILE *f; struct stat statBuf; int numBytes, numValues;

       f = fopen("binary.dat", "r"); fstat(fileno(f),  &amp;statBuf);  numBytes  =
       (int)statBuf.st_size;

       /*  Allocate an array big enough to hold all the data */ newArr = (dou-
       ble  *)malloc(numBytes);  numValues  =   numBytes   /   sizeof(double);
       fread((void *)newArr, numValues, sizeof(double), f); fclose(f);

       if (Blt_VectorExists(interp, "data"))  {
           if   (Blt_GetVector(interp,   "data",   &amp;vecPtr)   !=   TCL_OK)   {
               return TCL_ERROR;
           } } else {
          if  (Blt_CreateVector(interp,  "data",  0,  &amp;vecPtr)  !=  TCL_OK)  {
               return TCL_ERROR;
          } } /*
        * Reset the vector. Clients will be notified when Tk is idle.
        * TCL_DYNAMIC tells the vector to free the memory allocated
        * if it needs to reallocate or destroy the vector.
        */   if   (Blt_ResetVector(vecPtr,   newArr,   numValues,   numValues,
               TCL_DYNAMIC) != TCL_OK) {
           return TCL_ERROR; }

<H2>INCOMPATIBILITIES</H2><PRE>
       In previous versions, if the array variable isn't global (i.e. local to
       a Tcl procedure), the vector is automatically destroyed when the proce-
       dure returns.  proc doit {} {
           # Temporary vector x
           vector <B>x(10)</B>
           set <B>x(9)</B> 2.0
             ...  }

       This has changed.  Variables are not automatically destroyed when their
       variable  is  unset.   You  can restore the old behavior by setting the
       "-watchunset" switch.
