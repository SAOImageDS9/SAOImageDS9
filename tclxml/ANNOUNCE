TclXML version 3.2 is now available.

TclXML is a package that provides XML parsing for the Tcl scripting language.
It has two implementations of XML parsers: one written purely in Tcl
and a wrapper for the Gnome libxml2 C library.

The TclXML package now incorporates the TclDOM and TclXSLT packages.
TclDOM and TclXSLT were previously distributed as separate packages.
The three packages may still be used as if they were standalone.

Sources, and binaries for Mac OS X and MS Windows, are available now.  

These packages may be downloaded from the TclXML website:
