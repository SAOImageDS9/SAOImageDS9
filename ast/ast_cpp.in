# Replacement for the C pre-processor command "cpp" which is not
# always available. This uses the compiler command "cc" to do the same
# thing.  Also, this reads from standard input (which "cc" won't do).
#
# The name of the CPP processor is substituted in by the ./configure script,
# based on the result of the AC_PROG_CPP test.
#
#  The first (and only) argument for this script should be the path to
#  the directory containing the header files. This is passed to the C 
#  pre-processor using the -I option.
