This file records outstanding actions for the math module

dd. 4 november 2019
- Extend the set of test cases for linear interpolation with corner cases
  - these should fail with a clear error message.

dd. 4 september 2018
- Implement a "typical profile" for timeseries and determining residuals
  (Plus perhaps a notion of outliers)
- Implement detection of extreme values/periods with extreme values


dd. 17 june 2018
- Factor out the backward rotation in the intersection routines for circles
- Add a normalisation routine for vectors
- Add routines to construct a perpendicular vector and line
- Add a routine to return the perpendicular bisector of a line segment
- Add routines to deal with triangles (incircle, circumcircle)
- Add various other geometrical procs

- Add documentation of the new procs

dd. 12 june 2018
- Create a complex number based on modulus and argument

dd. 24 january 2018
- Implement plot positions for ranking in statistics package
- Implement a bootstrap method for selecting "new" samples
- Implement maximum likelihood methods for various distributions
  (exponential, normal and binomial are simple enough). Partly esthetical.

dd. 29 may 2017
- Implement Kronecker symbol (extension of Jacobi symbol)

dd. 8 january 2017
- Fix problem with test-anova-F (at least the test cases 1.1 and 1.2) - done


dd. 3 august 2016
- Fix problem in interpolation - integer arguments - done
- Fix problem in pdf-lognormal and cdf-lognormal: stdev is now used as variance - done

dd. 4 august 2016
- Add test case for permuted linear system - done
- Add test case for pdf-lognormal and cdf-lognormal (non-unity standard deviation) - done



dd. 11 april 2016
Fix problem in math::geometry::pointInsidePolygon (Eduard on comp.lang.tcl):

% set polygon "-764 -677 -668 -1341 -124 -797 -508 -406"
-764 -677 -668 -1341 -124 -797 -508 -406
% set point "838 456"
838 456
% package require math::geometry
1.1.3
% ::math::geometry::pointInsidePolygon $point $polygon
1

Possible solution at: https://www.ecse.rpi.edu/~wrf/Research/Short_Notes/pnpoly.html

I fixed the calculation of the point far away - but I want an edge case or two extra!


dd. 10 november 2015, Arjen Markus
Implement Box-Cox and Fisher's F test

Note: Fisher's F test implemented as test-anova-F

dd. 28 october 2015, Arjen Markus
Implement Dunnett's test for means and Levene's test for standard deviations


dd. 1 october 2015, Arjen Markus
Implement the following geometrical functions:
inproduct, crossProduct, areaParallellogram, unitVector, translate, rotate, rotateGeneral, reflect, reflectGeneral,
angleBetween, affine, degToRad, radToDeg, mkAffine

circles and triangles

Still to be implemented:
unitVector, rotateGeneral, reflectGeneral, affine, mkAffine

don't use lset, but lappend instead?

Describe the procedures

Implement tests

dd. 9 september 2015, Arjen Markus
Implement an inverse Student's t function - based on cephes library (cprob.tgz)

dd. 29 may 2015, Arjen Markus
- implement a wavelets module
- small stuff: create a proc that constructs a piece-wise linear function from a specification

dd. 26 april 2015, Arjen Markus
Add:
- additional linear algebra procedures by Federico Ferri
- lognormal income library by Eric Benedict
- empirical distribution
- tukey-duckworth test



dd. 18 january 2014, Arjen Markus
test cases for kernel-density:
One test case is troublesome - uniform kernel, checking the total density


dd. 26 october 2005, Arjen Markus

qcomplex.test: extend the tests for cos/sin .. to include
               non-real results.

dd. 28 september 2005, Arjen Markus

optimize.tcl: linear programming algorithm ignores certain
              constraints (of type x > 0). Needs to be
              fixed

dd. 22 june 2004, Arjen Markus

interpolate.man: add examples
interpolate.tcl: more consistency in the calling convention
                 checks on arguments (add tests for them)
optimize.man: example of a parametrized function (also a test case!)
optimize.tcl: provide an alternative for maximum
