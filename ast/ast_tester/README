This directory contains files used for performing some fairly restricted
testing of the AST library. A Fortran 77 compiler is required. As supplied 
it uses the g77 Fortran compiler, but this can be changed by editing the ast_tester 
script.

To perform a test:

- build AST 

- define the environment variables AST and STARLINK so that $AST/lib contains 
  the AST libraries to be tested, and $STARLINK/lib contains the the USSC libraries.

- If required, edit the ast_tester script to modify the fortran compiler and/or options.

- execute the ast_tester script.


The script generates various output files which are compared with existing files
which are presumed to represent correct behaviour of the AST library. Any differences
are reported by the script. 

The script also generates various postscript files representing "critically difficult" plots.
A file "*-new.ps" is created for each file "*.head" in the directory. The directory also
contains files "*.ps" which represent the expected appearance of the plots. By default, the 
new plots are displayed using ghostview. This can be disabled by specifying the "-nd" option 
on the ast_tester command line.
