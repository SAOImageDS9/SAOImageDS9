2010-08-13  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* canvas_zoom.tcl: Added missing Tk requirement. Bumped version to
	* canvas_zoom.man: 0.2.1. Updated documentation.
	* canvas_sqmap.tcl: Added missing Tk requirement. Bumped version to
	* canvas_sqmap.man: 0.3.1. Updated documentation.
	* pkgIndex.tcl:

2010-07-19  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* canvas_sqmap.tcl: Extend the class with two option to specify
	* canvas_sqmap.man: images to show while the image for a cell is
	* pkgIndex.tcl: loaded, and in cells for which there is no
	  image. Updated the documentation. Bumped the version to 0.3.

2010-07-16  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* ../../examples/canvas/osm.tcl: Another update of the app, Keith
	  added:
	  o computes distance between points: as you right click to
	    to add points, it shows the distance from start to end
	  o built in some initial locations (so not dependent on
	    locations.gps)
	  o hack to get the display shown nicely while initial maps
	    are loading
	  o double clicking a location automatically goes there
	  o safer way to process *.gps files instead of just using 'eval'
	  o shorten lat/lon to 6 decimal places

	  And I added a binding (Button 3 double-click) to center the map
	  at the mouse position. The zoom control has been 'place'd on the
	  canvas. This works best for the new control, see below.

	* canvas_zoom.tcl: Updated and modified by Keith. Only two buttons
	* canvas_zoom.man: (+/-, as images) and a label in the
	* pkgIndex.tcl: middle. Automatically uses tile/ttk widgets if
	  they are present. Simplified internals by using an unmapped
	  scale widget to handle all the variable tracing. Version bumped
	  to 0.2.

2010-07-07  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* ../../examples/canvas/city.tcl: Dropped the code trying
	* ../../examples/canvas/puzzle.tcl: to find and source
	* ../../examples/canvas/osm.tcl: packages relative to the
	  example's location. Assume that the packages are installed.
	  Further fixed issue with initial zoom level in osm.tcl.

2010-05-28  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* canvas_snap.tcl: Fixed oops, missing setup of our
	* canvas_snap.man: namespace. Version bumped to 1.0.1
	* pkgIndex.tcl: Thanks to George Petasis for noticing.

2010-05-26  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* canvas_snap.tcl: New package, taking snapshots of
	* canvas_snap.man: Canvases (to Tk photo image).
	* pkgIndex.tcl: Original author George Petasis, see
	  http://wiki.tcl.tk/1404.

	* Released and tagged Tklib 0.5 ========================

2008-11-26  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* canvas_zoom.man: Fixed syntax error in manpage I forgot to
	  validate.

2008-11-25  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ../../examples/canvas/osm_zoom.tcl: Removed zoom control and
	* ../../examples/canvas/tiles_xy_store_http.tcl: tile fetching.
	* ../../examples/canvas/osm.tcl: The former is now canvas::zoom,
	  the latter has been replaced by the map::slippy::* packages in
	  Tcllib. Updated the OSM example application to use these
	  packages now. Reordered its innards a bit as well.

	* canvas_zoom.tcl: Converted the zoom control in the canvas example
	* canvas_zoom.man: into a regular widget, and fixed a problem with
	* pkgIndex.tcl: viewport calculations (div-by-zero) in sqmap.
	* canvas_sqmap.tcl: Bumped version the of sqmap to 0.2
	* canvas_sqmap.man:

2008-11-23  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* canvas_sqmap.tcl (Reconfigure): Streamline internal operations a
	  bit ... I.e. no redraw before the viewport is stabilized, and
	  done only if not already done through the viewport move. Further
	  no irrelevant redraw request when forced through undefined
	  pixelview. At last, do never drop free items. As we configure
	  them to show no image even those not immediately reused are
	  effectively invisible and stay around until needed. This reduces
	  item destroy/create churn rate when we are forcing a full reload.

2008-11-23  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* canvas_sqmap.tcl: Removed guards from tilecache invokations in
	  the image methods. Could have prevented insertion of new image
	  into the cache, keeping an old image and making cache
	  inconsistent with the display. This needs cache::async 0.3 to
	  prevent a blow-up in the recursive call to the cache due to
	  recursive call and cleanup of notifications causding failure in
	  the outer call later. This was fixed in v0.3 of the cache::async.

2008-11-22  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* New module for extended canvas widgets.

	* canvas_sqmap.man: Extended canvas for map display, based on
	* canvas_sqmap.tcl: square image tiles. Plus examples.
	* pkgIndex.tcl:
