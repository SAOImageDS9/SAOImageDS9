I'm happy to announce version 1.4.6 of the "tkImg" package
(formerly known as 'Img").

This package enhances Tk, adding support for many other Image formats.

Changes compared to version 1.4.5:
- Fixed bug #85: Tk panic on exit when pixmap images have been created.
- Fixed bug #87: png darker in 1.4.5.
  Changed behaviour of gamma handling:
    Read: If no gamma is stored in PNG file, no gamma is set.
          Previous behaviour was to set it to 0.45.
    Write: No gamma value is written to PNG file.
           Previous behaviour was to set it to 1.0.
  Added 2 new PNG format options "-verbose" and "-gamma".

Changes compared to version 1.4.4:
-  Upgrade to libjpeg-9.2.0, libpng-1.6.21
-  Workaround for reading progressive JPEG images on Windows.
-  Performance optimization under Windows for "-format window".

Changes compared to version 1.4.3:
-  Upgrade to libpng-1.6.19, libtiff-3.9.7
-  Disable jbig support, as this generally cannot be relied upon (Bug #81)

Changes compared to version 1.4.2:
-  Bug fix when writing GIF images.
-  Bug fix when reading greyscale PNG images with alpha channel.
-  Added target install-libraries to install without documentation generation.

Changes compared to version 1.4.1:

-  Will build correctly on more platforms (TEA upgraded
   to latest version 3.9)
-  upgrade to zlib 1.2.8, libjpeg-8d
-  Added format option "-alpha" to PNG reader to be compatible with Tk 8.6.
-  Bug fixes in various parsers to avoid core dumps when specifying a
   wrong format option.

Changes compared to version 1.4:

-  Will build correctly on more platforms (TEA upgraded
   to version 3.9)
-  upgrade to zlib 1.2.7, libpng-1.4.12, libtiff-3.9.4, libjpeg-8c

This version only works with Tcl/Tk 8.3 or higher (tested up to
8.6.1). If you are using Tk8.2 or lower, please stick with tkImg1.3
(which is still available).

Currently there are three identical source distributions:
	tkimg145.zip             (for Windows)  (about 7.4 Mb)
	tkimg1.4.5.tar.gz        (for Unix)     (about 6.6 Mb)
	tkimg1.4.5.tar.bz2       (for Unix)     (about 4.9 Mb)

All these files can be downloaded from:
	http://sourceforge.net/projects/tkimg/

The most recent info is always available at:
	http://sourceforge.net/projects/tkimg/

See the README on how to build and use the packages.

For PNG, JPEG and TIFF support the supporting packages have to be
build and installed. See the file README for more in-depth
explanations.

For postscript you need Ghostscript (version 2.6 or higher) to be
available on your system.
