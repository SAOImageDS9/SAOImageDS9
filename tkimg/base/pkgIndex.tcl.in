# Actually we ask only for the format handlers, the required base
# packages will be loaded automatically through the usual package
# mechanism.

# When reading images without specifying it's format (option -format),
# the available formats are tried in reversed order as listed here.
# Therefore file formats with some "magic" identifier, which can be
# recognized safely, should be added at the end of this list.
