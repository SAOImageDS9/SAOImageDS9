This handler provides new additional configuration options. See
section [sectref {TIFF OPTIONS}] for more detailed explanations.


[include format-middle.inc]


In addition the value for the option is treated as list and may
contain any of the special options listed in section

[section {TIFF OPTIONS}]

The handler provides three options, one for reading from a TIFF image,
the other two influencing the writing of such. 


[list_begin definitions]

[lst_item "[option -index] [arg n]"]

This option is for reading from TIFF files containing more than one
image ([term {multi-page TIFF}]. When specified it
will read the [arg n]'th image in the data. The first image is at
index [const 0] and will be read by default, i.e. when the option is
not specified.

[lst_item "[option -compression] [arg type]"]

This option specifies the type of compression to use when writing TIFF
data. It has to be one of [const none], [const jpeg],
[const packbits], or [const deflate]. The default is [const none].


[lst_item "[option -byteorder] [arg type]"]

This option specifies the byteorder to use when writing TIFF data. It
has to be one of [const bigendian], [const littleendian],

[const network], [const smallendian], or the empty string. The default
is the empty string.

[nl]

The values [const bigendian] and [const network] are aliases of each
other, as are [const littleendian] and [const smallendian].
