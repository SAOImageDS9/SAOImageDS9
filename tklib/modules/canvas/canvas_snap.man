[description]

This package provides a command to take snapshots of arbitrary
canvases.

[section API]

[list_begin definitions]

[call [cmd ::canvas::snap] [arg pathName]]

Takes a snapshot of the canvas [arg pathName]. The result is the name
of a new Tk photo image containing the snapshot.

[para]

[emph Note] that this command has a side-effect. To avoid having white
rectangles where other windows may overlap the canvas this command
forces the toplevel window the canvas is in to the top of the stacking
order.
