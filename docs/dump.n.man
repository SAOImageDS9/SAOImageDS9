[description]
[para]
The dump command provides a way for the user to spit out state
information about the interpreter in a Tcl readable
(and human readable) form.
It takes the general form:

[list_begin definitions]

[call [cmd dump] [arg method]\
		 [opt [arg -nocomplain]]\
		 [opt [arg "-filter pattern"]]\
		 [opt [cmd --]]\
		 [arg pattern]\
		 [opt [arg "pattern ..."]]]

[list_end]

[para]
The patterns represent glob-style patterns (as in [cmd string] [arg {match pattern $str}]).
[arg -nocomplain] will prevent dump from throwing an error if no items
matched the pattern.
[arg -filter] is interpreted as appropriate for the method.
The various methods are:

[list_begin definitions]

[def "[cmd dump] [arg command] [arg args]"]
Outputs one or more commands.

[def "[cmd dump] [arg procedure] [arg args]"]
Outputs one or more procs in sourceable form.

[def "[cmd dump] [arg variable] [arg args]"]
Outputs the values of variables in sourceable form.
Recognizes nested arrays.
The -filter pattern is used as to filter array element
names and is interepreted as a glob pattern (defaults to {*}).
It is passed down for nested arrays.

[def "[cmd dump] [arg widget] [arg args]"]
Outputs one or more widgets by giving their configuration options.
The -filter pattern is used as to filter the config options and
is interpreted as a case insensitive regexp pattern (defaults to {.*}).
