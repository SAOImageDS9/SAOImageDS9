This file summarizes all changes made to Img since version 1.0 was
released in April, 1997.

6/5/97  (bug fix) removed fclose() in imgTIFF.c, because the generic
	image code already closes the file. This resulted in a crash
	on some machines, when reading a tiff file from disk.

6/9/97  Added Channel functions for all format handlers. Needed to
	make everything work again in combination with Tk8.0b1.

6/12/97 Removed Xlib sub-directory and moved tkWinInt.h and tkMacInt.h
	to the main directory. reason: Xlib.h is already installed by
	Tk, so there is no need for Img to do it as well.

6/12/97 (bug-fix) test.png in reality was an XPM file.

6/12/97 Upgraded libpng to version 0.96

7/1/97  Removed __eprintf() function: The assert() function
	(which was the problem) can be disabled with
	-DNDEBUG as well, which is much simpler.

7/1/97  Fixed bug in PNG interlace handling: Now interlaced
	images will be produced by default.

7/1/97  Added support for animated GIF. Not complete yet.

7/10/97 Added support for binary I/O in all format handlers. The
	initialization automatically detects if the current Tcl
	version supports this.

7/11/97 Construction of new patch.tk8, which combines Steve Ball's
	work with mine. Now binary I/O is fully supported.

7/16/97 Removed the "fromData" hack from all format handlers.

7/17/97 Speedup of TIFF format handler: No longer uses a temporary
	file to store intermediate results, but does everyting
	in memory. This enhancement uses the function TIFFClientOpen,
	which is only available in newer TIFF libraries. If this
	function cannot be found, the slower original approach is
	taken.

7/18/97 Added support for BMP format. Still incomplete.

7/20/97 Completed support for animated GIF. Added example animated
	GIF to demo.

7/24/97 Added support for 1-bit BMP images. Now only
	RLE decompressing left to be implemented.

7/26/97 Changed TIFF handler such that libz and libjpeg are
	only loaded when needed (new files imgTIFFjpeg.c and
	imgTIFFzip.c, adapted from tif_jpeg.c and tif_zip.c
	from the TIFF source).

7/26/97 Added postscript format handler (imgPS.c), read only.
	Assumes that Ghostscript (version 2.6 or higher)
	is installed on your system.

7/28/97 Changed GIF format string to be "gif -index <n>" in stead of
	"gif <n>". The old format is still accepted for backwards
	compatibility with version 1.1b1, but no longer documented.

8/1/97  Added option "-zoom" to postscript handler.

8/11/97 Modified all patches to correct the "imageName copy"
	command. Previously it didn't handle transparency
	correctly. Plus another bug fix related to the alpha
	channel. Thanks to Nick Ing-Simmons <nick@ni-s.u-net.com>
	for providing the fix.

8/12/97 Bug fix. Transparency turned out not to be handled correctly
	for paletted PNG images. Tk and XV cannot produce such images, that's
	why this is not discovered earlier. Thanks to Stephane Lavirotte
	<Stephane.Lavirotte@sophia.inria.fr> for pointing this out.

8/13/97 Converted the "format" argument of the Image API to Tcl_Obj's.
	This influenced all source files and "patch.tk8". So, you
	cannot use older versions of "patch.tk8" with Img1.1 any more,
	and the latest "patch.tk8" doesn't work with Img1.1b3 as well.

8/16/97 Added "install.tcl" and "tkv.tcl"

8/18/97 Tcl8.0a1 and Tcl8.0a2 are no longer supported.

8/18/97 Adapted "patch.tk8" to the final Tk8.0 release. Constructed
	new files "patchtk8.tgz" and "patchtk8.zip", which contain
	a collection of the Tk8.0 files that changed. The latter files
	are not distributed with Img 1.1, but can be found in the
	same directory where you got Img 1.1.

----------------- Released 1.1, 8/18/97  -----------------------

8/21/97 (bug fix) "tkv.tcl" didn't display the menu's correctly using
	Tk4.2, apart from the fact that they turned out to look horrible
	on Windows anyway. In combination with Tk8.0, Tkv uses the new
	menu interface now, which doesn't have this problem.

8/21/97 (bug fix) "demo.tcl" changed the working directory when the
	additional tests are interrupted by using the "dismiss" button.

8/21/97 (bug fix) Removed POSIX dependancies from imgInit.c, imgPmap.c,
	imgPS.c and imgTIFF.c. This will make porting to non-POSIX
	systems (e.g. Mac) easier, but makes no difference on
	POSIX-compliant machines.

8/22/97 Added file MW_ImgHeader.pch, which is used as a pre-compilied
	header source for all files in the Img package. This make compilies
	go a bit faster. This file is only intended to be used in the
	MetroWerks CodeWarrior environment.

8/24/97 Added "patch.tkx", which enhances the TclX help system to
	reflect the changes in patch.tk4 and patch.tk8

8/26/97 (bug fix) JPEG handler crashed on some machines when writing
	big JPEG images to disk. Thanks to Peter T. Waltenberg
	<p.waltenberg@irl.cri.nz> for reporting this bug, and for
	providing an example script which demonstrated this problem.

8/27/97 (bug fix) Serveral minor changes to remove warning when compiling
	under Windows and Mac. Thanks to Mazin As-Sanie <mazina@eecs.umich.edu>
	for reporting those to me.

8/27/97 (bug fix) Eliminated Tcl_Realloc() call in imgTIFF.c. This function
	didn't exist yet in Tk4.2 and before.

9/5/97  (bug fix) install.tcl assumed that the PATH enviroment variable
	was a ':'-separated list. This is correct on UNIX, but on Windows
	the separation character should be ';'

9/7/97  (bug fix) Fixed patch.tk8 such that the "imgName copy" command
	handles transparency fully correct. Previously copied pixels
	just replaced the existing pixels and the regions were not
	merged correctly. Now that has been fixed. If a partially trans-
	parent pixel is copied on top of an already partially transparent
	pixel, a new color and a new transparency value is determined,
	consisting of a combination of both.

9/8/97  (bug fix) GIF handler didn't handle local colormaps correctly.
	Lucky enough most GIF's only have a global colormap.

----------------- Released 1.1p1, 9/9/97  -----------------------

10/1/97  (bug-fix) Oops. Previous bug-fix was not correct :-(
	 Still didn't work with local colormaps.

10/17/97 (bug fix) patch.tix didn't correctly initialize
	 the variable "format", because this variable
	 was disturbed by the new initialization code.

10/22/97 (bug-fix) Applied the official patch #1 to libz 1.0.4.
	 This makes the library more robust in respect to
	 corrupted compressed streams. (see README.ZLIB)

11/1/97  (bug-fix, feature change) Upgraded tiff library
	 to version 3.4.37 (was 3.4.33)

11/1/97  Eliminated the function Tk_ParseArgv(), which makes
	 the tiff- and jpeg- handlers thread-safe. As long as
	 Tk is not thread-safe this doesn't help much, but at
	 least Img is prepared now for the multi-threaded future.

11/3/97  Added rule to makefile.vc to build Img for Tk8.1. This is
	 not guaranteed because Tk8.1 is not released yet, but if
	 there are not too much incompatibilities it should work.

11/3/97  Enhanced the bitmap image type (in patch.tk8) to use
	 the new Tcl_Obj API.

11/9/97  (feature change) Adapted patch.tk4 and patch.tk8 such
	 that "imageName read" and "imageName put" now return
	 the format of the readed data in stead of the empty string.

11/9/97  (feature change) Added logluv compression support to
	 TIFF format handler.

11/9/97  Recreated patch.tk8 using Tk8.0p1, and also created
	 new files patchtk8.tgz and patchtk8.zip from it.
	 Documented that Img is now tested with Tk8.0p1 as well.

----------------- Released 1.1p2, 11/10/97  -----------------------

11/15/97 (new feature) Added imgWindow.c

11/25/97 (new feature) Added libttf.so (ttf.dll on Windows)

11/27/97 (enhancement) Made the changes required by the new Apple
	 Universal Headers V.3.0, so that Img will compile with CW Pro 2.

11/30/97 PNG hopepage has moved. Changed README.PNG accordingly.

12/7/97  Added PDF encoder, using ghostscript. Doesn't work yet.

12/15/97 Removed support for Tk4.2.

12/30/97 Added support for byteArrays. This fixes binary I/O in
	 combination with Tk8.1a1.

1/27/98  Added patch.tk81a1, created with the official Tk8.1a1
	 distribution.

1/28/98  Upgrade to libz version 1.0.8.

----------------- Released 1.2a1, 1/28/98  -----------------------

2/27/98  Upgrade to libz version 1.0.8.

2/27/98  Upgrade to libpng version 0.99d, fixing shared library
         version number to 2.0.99, as suggested by png.h.

10/25/98 Fixed imgWindow.c for Windows. Patch supplied by
	 Robin Becker <robin@jessikat.demon.co.uk>.

11/19/98 Upgrade to libz 1.1.3, libpng 1.0.2 and libttf 2.0.1.

11/19/98 Fixed configure script in order to work with Tcl8.0.3
	 and also the upcoming 8.0.4 and 8.0.5

3/14/99  Added 8.1b2 compatible Stub support

3/14/99  Removed libttf and libgif support.

----------------- Released 1.2b1, 3/14/99  -----------------------

3/19/99  Finished "Makefile.gnu". Some more tweaking of Tk and CygWin
	 header-files is needed to make it work, but at least Img has
	 full CygWin support now. Only works with CygWin B20.1 and higher.

3/29/99  Better support for byte-compiler in demo.tcl and tkv.tcl,
	 using {}'s around expressions always. Also removing
	 old Tk4.2 compatible menu-code.

3/29/99  Internal changes, using Tcl_Obj's in more places.
	 Suggested by Nick Ing-Simmons. This will make the
	 port to perl/Tk easier.

3/29/99  Upgrade to libpng 1.0.3

----------------- Released 1.2b2, 3/29/99  -----------------------

5/23/99  Documentation enhancements: Everything is available in
         html now.

----------------- Released 1.2, 5/23/99  -----------------------

9/3/99   Added suitable patch for Tk8.2.0

9/7/99   Modified BMP generation to generate 8-bit paletted if
         there are less than 257 colors but more than 512 pixels.
         Donated by Roger E Critchlow Jr <rec@elf.org>

9/7/99   Upgraded tiff library to version 3.5.1, thereby disabling
         lzw support.

----------------- Released 1.2.1, 9/16/99  -----------------------

10/16/99 Upgraded tiff library to version 3.5.2 and png library
         to version 1.0.5.  LZW-support is still disabled.

10/19/99 Modified PNG gamma correction following the latest
         PNG 1.2 specification.

10/26/99 Applied official fax3-patch to libtiff 3.5.2, fixing
         certain fax3 images (whatever that may be.....).

10/26/99 Modified zlib to use the _stdcall in stead of the _cdecl
         convention. This is the way Gilles Vollent compiles it's
         zlib dll's, and he is the 'official' zlib windows maintainer.
         INCOMPATIBLE on Windows!!!!!!!!!!!!!

10/26/99 Fixed undocumented base-64 encoder/decoder to correctly
         report "wrong number of arguments".

10/27/99 Fixed bug in BMP handler, which caused sometimes colors
         to be distorted when reading certain BMP images.

----------------- Released 1.2.2, 10/27/99  -----------------------

11/10/99 Modified all handlers to use the extended Photo API when
	 running with Tk8.3 or higher.

11/10/99 Fixed tkv.tcl (from demo.tcl) and tests to be independant
	 from working directory.

11/10/99 Fixed libpng/makefile.vc to use _stdcall convention for
	 zlib functions.

1/15/2000 Fixed "-encoding none" problem.

1/15/2000 Upgraded libtiff to version 3.5.4

1/15/2000 All handler names are now in lower-case.

----------------- Released 1.2.3, 1/16/2000  -----------------------

5/7/2000 Added some missing symbols to tclLoadNone.c

5/7/2000 Fixed missing "-rpath" option. Bug reported by Larry Virden.

5/7/2000 Made PNG handler independant of jmpbuf support in libpng.
         This makes Img work with libpng 1.1 (still in beta, and
         unlikely ever to be released to the public), and hopefully
         also with more future libpng versions.

5/10/2000 Fixed possible infinite loop in XBM format handler. Bug
         reported by Gianandrea Rigoni

5/11/2000 Changed URL of zlib and libpng to point to the current
          location everywhere.

7/8/2000  Upgraded libtiff to version 3.5.5

7/9/2000  Internationalized demo.tcl and tkv.tcl

7/13/2000 Bug-fix in BMP write function. If an image contained more
          than 256 colors, only the first 256 where stored in the
          color table. Bug reported by higuchi@cov.tytlabs.co.jp

8/9/2000  Upgraded libpng to version 1.0.8

8/11/2000  Fixed Postscript handling when the image size is larger
          than the default page size. BUG-report and fix suggestion
          by Carlos Vidal.

8/12/2000 Made PNG handler independant of the png_init_io() function
          and stdio; some libpng versions (e.g. the official dll's
          for Windows from the PNG group) lack this function
          (and for a good reason............).

8/12/2000 Removed the patches subdirectory from the distribution. If
          you are able to install the patches, you are also able to
          install Tcl 8.3.2 (or higher), which is a much better idea.

----------------- Released 1.2.4, 8/13/2000  -----------------------
