What is new in Wcb 3.6?
-----------------------

1. Adapted to some changes in future Tcl and Tk releases (for example,
   made sure that it works with Tcl 9.0 and Tk 8.7).

2. Updated the demo-scripts and the documentation.

What was new in Wcb 3.5?
------------------------

1. Support for the tile treeview widget.

2. Minor performance improvements.

3. Improved and updated the documentation.

What was new in Wcb 3.4?
------------------------

The only changes contained in this release are related to the package
mechanism, needed for a better teacup support (thanks to Oliver Bienert
and Andreas Kupries for discussions on this subject).

What was new in Wcb 3.3?
------------------------

The only changes contained in this release are a few adaptations made
necessary by submitting the package for inclusion in tklib (thanks to
Stuart Cassoff for his proposal and valuable assistance).

What was new in Wcb 3.2?
------------------------

1. Support for the new tile spinbox widget, introduced in Tk version
   8.6 and tile version 0.8.3.

2. Callback support for the new "replace" text widget subcommand,
   introduced in Tk 8.6.

3. New utility procedure "postDeleteEntryText" for Tk entry, tile entry,
   BWidget Entry, Tk spinbox, tile spinbox, and tile combobox widgets.

4. Updated the demo scripts "listboxtest1.tcl" and "listboxtest2.tcl" to
   work with Tk versions 8.5 and above.

What was new in Wcb 3.1?
------------------------

1. Support for the tile entry and combobox widgets.

2. Support for the ctext widget by George Peter Staplin (thanks to
   Kenneth Green for his proposal).

3. Minor improvements in the documentation.

What was new in Wcb 3.0?
------------------------

1. Callback support for the new tablelist commands "activatecell",
   "cellselection set", and "cellselection clear", introduced in
   Tablelist version 3.5.

2. Minor improvements in the code and documentation.

What was new in Wcb 2.9?
------------------------

1. Applied a patch proposed (in a slightly different form) by Mats
   Bengtsson that works around a bug in the "info script" command on
   the Macintosh.

2. The code and the documentation now explicitly mention the support
   for the Entry widget from the BWidget package.  Everything that
   refers to entry widgets is valid for BWidget Entry widgets, too.

3. A new demo script showing how widget callbacks can be combined with
   the undo mechanism for text widgets.

4. Improvements in the demo scripts and documentation.

What was new in Wcb 2.8?
------------------------

1. The before/after-selset and before/after-selclear callbacks are now
   supported for text widgets, too (where they refer to the "tag add
   sel" and "tag remove sel" operations).

2. The demo script "texttest.tcl" now also shows how to use a before-
   selset callback for protecting a range of characters in a text
   widget from being selected.

3. Minor improvements in the code, demo scripts, and documentation.

4. The distribution file "wcb2_8.zip" for Windows now includes the
   "wcb2.8" directory, hence it is no longer necessary to create this
   folder before unpacking the distribution file.

What was new in Wcb 2.7?
------------------------

1. Fixed a bug in the private procedure "textWidgetCmd" (thanks to
   Brian Theado for his bug report).

2. Extended the private procedure "cleanup", to improve the support
   for tablelist widgets (thanks to Juri Shimon for his bug report).

3. Extended the "How to use it?" section of the tutorial "wcb.html".

What was new in Wcb 2.6?
------------------------

1. Fixed a bug introduced in version 2.5 in the private procedure
   "processCmd" (thanks to Juri Shimon for his bug report).

2. Added the before-insert callbacks "checkStrForRegExp" and
   "checkStrsForRegExp".

3. Internationalized the sample before-insert callbacks
   "checkStrFor*" and "checkStrsFor*" for Tk versions 8.1 or higher.

4. The text widget callbacks "checkStrsFor*" now accept also "\n"
   characters.

What was new in Wcb 2.5?
------------------------

1. New "pathname" command to query the path name of the widget
   corresponding to a Tcl command name (this was kindly suggested by
   Bastien Chevreux).

2. Improved the implementations of the "cancel", "extend", and
   "replace" commands, as well as of the private procedure
   "processCmd", to make sure that the data used by different widgets
   won't intermix (thanks to Leslie Brooks for his bug report).

3. Improved the parsing of configuration and command options.

What was new in Wcb 2.4?
------------------------

1. A callback is now considered empty if and only if it is an empty
   *string*, not an empty *list*, like in earlier versions.  This is
   better because the "llength" command, used in earlier versions,
   doesn't work if its argument is not a well-formed list.

2. The command reference has been moved from the file "wcb.html" into
   "wcbRef.html", which is also included in the documentation of the
   Mentry package.

3. Further improvements in the documentation.

What was new in Wcb 2.3?
------------------------

1. The "changeEntryText" command now returns the value 0 if the
   attempted change gets canceled by some before-delete or before-
   insert callback, and 1 otherwise.  (This was kindly suggested by
   Aryeh Koenigsberg.)

2. Support for the new Tk core spinbox widget if Tk version 8.4 or
   higher is being used.  Everything that refers to entry widgets is
   valid for spinbox widgets, too.

3. Support for the new tablelist widget (see http://www.nemethi.de).
   Everything that refers to listbox widgets is valid for tablelist
   widgets, too.

4. Minor improvements in the code and documentation.

What was new in Wcb 2.2?
------------------------

1. The demo script "texttest.tcl" now uses a before- instead of after-
   motion callback to keep track of the position of the insertion
   cursor.  The manual file "wcb.html" explains the reason for this
   change.

2. Minor improvements in the documentation.

What was new in Wcb 2.1?
------------------------

1. Fixed a bug in the procedure "cbprepend", introduced in version 2.0.

2. Included a new demo script using an activate callback for a listbox.
   This new example is also discussed in the manual file "wcb.html".

3. Minor improvements in the code and documentation.

What was new in Wcb 2.0?
------------------------

1. To load the package, you can now pass either "Wcb" or "wcb" to the
   "package require" command (earlier versions only supported the
   package name "Wcb").

2. The current version 2.0 contains the new basic procedures "cbappend",
   "cbprepend", and "canceled", the new utility procedure
   "changeEntryText", and the new before-insert callback
   "checkEntryForUInt".

3. Several significant improvements have been made in the code, with the
   purpose to save resources and make the implementation more straight-
   forward.

4. In case of an error, the new Tcl procedure corresponding to a widget
   with registered callbacks now outputs exactly the same error message
   and sets the "errorInfo" variable to the same value as the original
   Tcl command associated with the widget.  That is, the behavior of a
   widget in case of an error is now the same, whether it has callbacks
   or not.

5. The demo script "texttest.tcl" now also shows how to keep track of
   the position of the insertion cursor by using an after-motion
   callback.
