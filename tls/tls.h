 * TLS (aka SSL) Channel - can be layered on any bi-directional
 * Tcl_Channel (Note: Requires Trf Core Patch)
 *
 * This was built from scratch based upon observation of OpenSSL 0.9.2B
 *
 * Addition credit is due for Andreas Kupries (a.kupries@westend.com), for
 * providing the Tcl_ReplaceChannel mechanism and working closely with me
 * to enhance it to support full fileevent semantics.
 *
 * Also work done by the follow people provided the impetus to do this "right":-
 *	tclSSL (Colin McCormack, Shared Technology)
 *	SSLtcl (Peter Antman)
