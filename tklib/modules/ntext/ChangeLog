2018-02-17  Keith Nash  <kjnash@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Bugfix - generate <<Selection>> for Tk < 8.6.9 in the corner case in
	  which the CLIPBOARD is <<Paste>>d into the PRIMARY selection.
	* Increase version to 1.0b3

2018-01-26  Keith Nash  <kjnash@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Update to correspond to current tk8.x/text.tcl --
	  core-8-5-branch 2015-10-04 artifact [6af61544] check-in [55133bde]
	  core-8-6-branch 2017-09-22 artifact [24e611b8] check-in [ba5ef805]
	  trunk           2017-10-07 artifact [642cbaf3] check-in [429e2357]
	  revised_text    2018-01-15 artifact [a76837e9] check-in [74f86687]
	* Adapt to work with revised_text.
	* Add revisions made to Tk library/text.tcl since the last release
	  of ntext.
	* When indenting word-wrapped lines, use the text widget tag option
	  -lmargincolor if available (i.e. for Tk 8.6.6 and above). Add command
	  ::ntext::syncIndentColor and variable ::ntext::indentColor for this
	  purpose.
	* Add the option to use the block cursor when in "overwrite" mode.  Make
	  this the default for Tk 8.5.12 or newer (earlier versions have a bug
	  in their block cursor).
	* Generate a <<Selection>> event when the PRIMARY selection changes
	  as a result of an "insert" or "delete" operation, in older versions of
	  Tk. (This missing feature is added to the text widget itself in
	  Tk 8.6.9.)
	* Add a new example for unusual scrolling cases identified in
	  revised_text.
	* Update docs and examples.
	* Increase version to 1.0b2

	* Don't call private commands from tk8.x/text.tcl (for compatibility

	* Show correct cursor for insert/overwrite when there are multiple
	  widgets.
