	* installFile.tcl: Added updating of the modification time of
	  the target file whether we overwrote it or decided that it
	  hadn't changed.  This was necessary for us to be able to
	  determine whether or not a module install touched the file.

	* installFile.tcl: Added support for converting new-style (1.1+) 
	  Cygnus drive paths to Tcl-style.

        * tcl.m4: Fixed typo in SC_LIB_SPEC where it is checking
	for exec-prefix.

        * tcl.m4: Concatenated most of the Ajuba acsite.m4 file
	so we don't need to modify the autoconf installation.
	* config.guess:
	* config.sub:
	* installFile.tcl:
	Added files from the itcl config subdirectory,
	which should go away.

        * Fixed the use of TCL_SRC_DIR and TK_SRC_DIR within TCL_PRIVATE_INCLUDES
	and TK_PRIVATE_INCLUDES to match their recent change from $(srcdir)
	to $(srcdir)/..
