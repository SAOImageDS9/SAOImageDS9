/*
*class++
*  Name:
*     Region

*  Purpose:
*     Represents a region within a coordinate system.

*  Constructor Function:
*     None.

*  Description:
*     This class provides the basic facilities for describing a region within
*     a specified coordinate system. However, the Region class does not
*     have a constructor function of its own, as it is simply a container
*     class for a family of specialised sub-classes such as Circle, Box, etc,
*     which implement Regions with particular shapes.
*
*     All sub-classes of Region require a Frame to be supplied when the Region
*     is created. This Frame describes the coordinate system in which the
*     Region is defined, and is referred to as the "encapsulated Frame" below.
*     Constructors will also typically required one or more positions to be
*     supplied which define the location and extent of the region. These
*     positions must be supplied within the encapsulated Frame.
*
*     The Region class inherits from the Frame class, and so a Region can be
*     supplied where-ever a Frame is expected. In these cases, supplying a
*     Region is equivalent to supplying a reference to its encapsulated Frame.
*     Thus all the methods of the Frame class can be used on the Region class.
*     For instance, the
c     astFormat function
f     AST_FORMAT routine
*     may be used on a Region to format an axis value.
*
*     In addition, since Frame inherits from Mapping, a Region is also a sort
*     of Mapping. Transforming positions by supplying a Region to one of the
c     astTran<X> functions
f     AST_TRAN<X> routines
*     is the way to determine if a given position is inside or outside the
*     Region (but see also the convenience function
c     astPointInRegion).
f     AST_POINTINREGION).
*     When used as a Mapping, most classes of Frame are equivalent to
*     a UnitMap. However, the Region class modifies this behaviour so that a
*     Region acts like a UnitMap only for input positions which are within the
*     area represented by the Region. Input positions which are outside the
*     area produce bad output values (i.e. the output values are equal to
*     AST__BAD). This behaviour is the same for both the forward and the
*     inverse transformation. In this sense the "inverse transformation"
*     is not a true inverse of the forward transformation, since applying
*     the forward transformation to a point outside the Region, and then
*     applying the inverse transformation results, in a set of AST__BAD axis
*     values rather than the original axis values. If required, the
c     astRemoveRegions
f     AST_REMOVEREGIONS
*     function can be used to remove the "masking" effect of any Regions
*     contained within a compound Mapping or FrameSet. It does this by
*     replacing each Region with a UnitMap or equivalent Frame (depending
*     on the context in which the Region is used).
*
*     If the coordinate system represented by the Region is changed (by
*     changing the values of one or more of the attribute which the Region
*     inherits from its encapsulated Frame), the area represented by
*     the Region is mapped into the new coordinate system. For instance, let's
*     say a Circle (a subclass of Region) is created, a SkyFrame being
*     supplied to the constructor so that the Circle describes a circular
*     area on the sky in FK4 equatorial coordinates. Since Region inherits
*     from Frame, the Circle will have a System attribute and this attribute
*     will be set to "FK4". If the System attribute of the Region is then
*     changed from FK4 to FK5, the circular area represented by the Region
*     will automatically be mapped from the FK4 system into the FK5 system.
*     In general, changing the coordinate system in this way may result in the
*     region changing shape - for instance, a circle may change into an
*     ellipse if the transformation from the old to the new coordinate system
*     is linear but with different scales on each axis. Thus the specific
*     class of a Region cannot be used as a guarantee of the shape in any
*     particular coordinate system. If the
c     astSimplify function
f     AST_SIMPLIFY routine
*     is used on a Region, it will endeavour to return a new Region of
*     a sub-class which accurately describes the shape in the current
*     coordinate system of the Region (but this may not always be possible).
*
*     It is possible to negate an existing Region so that it represents all
*     areas of the encapsulated Frame except for the area specified when
*     the Region was created.

*  Inheritance:
*     The Region class inherits from the Frame class.

*  Attributes:
*     In addition to those attributes common to all Frames, every
*     Region also has the following attributes:
*
*     - Adaptive: Should the area adapt to changes in the coordinate system?
*     - Negated: Has the original region been negated?
*     - Closed: Should the boundary be considered to be inside the region?
*     - MeshSize: Number of points used to create a mesh covering the Region
*     - FillFactor: Fraction of the Region which is of interest
*     - Bounded: Is the Region bounded?
*
*     Every Region also inherits any further attributes that belong
*     to the encapsulated Frame, regardless of that Frame's class. (For
*     example, the Equinox attribute, defined by the SkyFrame class, is
*     inherited by any Region which represents a SkyFrame.)

*  Functions:
c     In addition to those functions applicable to all Frames, the
c     following functions may also be applied to all Regions:
f     In addition to those routines applicable to all Frames, the
f     following routines may also be applied to all Regions:

*  Authors:
*     DSB: David S. Berry (STARLINK)

*  History:
*     3-DEC-2003 (DSB):
*        Original version.
*     12-MAY-2005 (DSB):
*        Override astNormBox method.
*     12-AUG-2005 (DSB):
*        Override ObsLat and ObsLon accessor methods.
*     14-FEB-2006 (DSB):
*        Override astGetObjSize.
*     2-MAR-2006 (DSB):
*        Changed AST_LONG_DOUBLE to HAVE_LONG_DOUBLE.
*     14-MAR-2006 (DSB):
*        Added astGetRefFS.
*     28-MAY-2007 (DSB):
*        - Added protected function astBndMesh.
*     14-JAN-2009 (DSB):
*        Override the astIntersect method.
*     20-JAN-2009 (DSB):
*        Change astPickAxes so that it returns a Region rather than a
*        Frame if possible. This included adding method astRegBasePick.
*     9-FEB-2009 (DSB):
*        Move PointList methods astGetEnclosure and astSetEnclosure to
*        Region.
*     18-FEB-2009 (DSB):
*        Remove methods astGetEnclosure and astSetEnclosure.
*     15-JUN-2009 (DSB):
*        Modify MapRegion to use FrameSets properly.
*     18-JUN-2009 (DSB):
*        Override ObsAlt accessor methods.
*     7-SEP-2009 (DSB):
*        Fix astMask to avoid reading variance values from the data array.
*     8-SEP-2009 (DSB):
*        Fix bugs in astOverlap that could result in wrong results if
*        either region is unbounded.
*     4-JAN-2010 (DSB):
*        Fix bug in GetRegionBounds (it was assumed implicitly that the base
*        Frame had the same number of axes as the current Frame).
*     18-MAR-2011 (DSB):
*        Added astGetRegionMesh public method.
*     22-MAR-2011 (DSB):
*        Improve uniformity of points produced by astRegBaseGrid method.
*     29-APR-2011 (DSB):
*        Prevent astFindFrame from matching a subclass template against a
*        superclass target.
*     17-MAY-2011 (DSB):
*        In RegBaseGrid, accept the final try even if it is not within 5%
*        of the required meshsize.
*     27-APR-2012 (DSB):
*        Store a negated copy of itself with each Region. Changing the Negated
*        attribute of a Region causes the cached information to be reset, and
*        re-calculating it can be an expensive operation. So instead of changing
*        "Negatated" in "this", access the negated copy of "this" using the
*        new protected method astGetNegation.
*     7-JUN-2012 (DSB):
*        Added protected astRegSplit method to split a Region into disjoint
*        component regions.
*     15-JUN-2012 (DSB):
*        Guard against division by zero in RegBase Grid if "ipr" is zero.
*     7-NOV-2013 (DSB):
*        Added method astGetRegionFrameSet.
*     3-FEB-2014 (DSB):
*        Fix bug masking regions that have no overlap with the supplied array.
*     17-APR-2015 (DSB):
*        Added Centre.
*     26-OCT-2016 (DSB):
*        - Override the astAxNorm method.
*        - Use astAxNorm to fix a bug in astGetRegionBounds for cases where
*        the Region cross a longitude=0 singularity.
*     11-NOV-2016 (DSB):
*        When loading a Region, use the dimensionality of the base Frame
*        of the FrameSet (rather than the current Frame as it used to be)
*        to define the number of axes required in the PointSet.
*     1-DEC-2016 (DSB):
*        Changed MapRegion to remove any unnecessary base frame axes in
*        the returned Region.
*     15-NOV-2018 (DSB):
*        Use error code AST__NOIMP instead of AST__INTER when reporting
*        an error about an abstract method not being implemented.
*     4-DEC-2018 (DSB):
*        Change GetBounded so that Regions defined within SkyFrames are
*        always bounded, whether negated or not.
*     11-DEC-2018 (DSB):
*        Add astGetRegionDisc.
*     16-JAN-2019 (DSB):
*        Change Conv() so that it aligns in the current Frame of "to". Without this,
*        it is possible for uncertainty regions to be mapped incorrectly into the
*        frame of the new region when creating new regions.
*     29-AUG-2019 (DSB):
*        - Re-implement the OverlapX function. The original implementation,
*        which relied on the distinction between bounded and unbounded regions,
*        failed for some Regions defined within a SkyFrame, since the
*        negation of a bounded region on the sky is also bounded (unlike
*        regions defiend in cartesian spaces).
*     24-SEP-2019 (DSB):
*        Added 8-byte interface for astMask<X>.
*     23-JAN-2020 (DSB):
*        Added astPointInRegion.
*class--

*  Implementation Notes:
*     - All sub-classes must over-ride the following abstract methods
*     declared in this class: astRegBaseBox, astRegBaseMesh, astRegPins,
*     astRegTrace. They must also extend the astTransform method. In addition
*     they should usually extend astSimplify and astRegCentre.

/*
*  Name:
*     Abbrev

*  Purpose:
*     Abbreviate a formatted Region axis value by skipping leading fields.

*  Type:
*     Private function.

*  Synopsis:
*     #include "region.h"
*     const char *Abbrev( AstFrame *this, int axis, const char *fmt,
*                         const char *str1, const char *str2, int *status )

*  Class Membership:
*     Region member function (over-rides the protected astAbbrev
*     method inherited from the Frame class).

*  Description:
*     This function compares two Region axis values that have been
*     formatted (using astFormat) and determines if they have any
*     redundant leading fields (i.e. leading fields in common which
*     can be suppressed when tabulating the values or plotting them on
*     the axis of a graph).

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the Region
*     axis
*        The number of the Region axis for which the values have
*        been formatted (axis numbering starts at zero for the first
*        axis).
*     fmt
*        Pointer to a constant null-terminated string containing the
*        format specification used to format the two values.
*     str1
*        Pointer to a constant null-terminated string containing the
*        first formatted value.
*     str1
*        Pointer to a constant null-terminated string containing the
*        second formatted value.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     A pointer into the "str2" string which locates the first
*     character in the first field that differs between the two
*     formatted values.
*
*     If the two values have no leading fields in common, the returned
*     value will point at the start of string "str2". If the two
*     values are equal, it will point at the terminating null at the
*     end of this string.

*  Notes:
*     - This function assumes that the format specification used was

*     method inherited from the Frame class).

*  Description:
*     This function returns a deep copy of an ancestral component of the
*     supplied object. The required class of the ancestral component is
*     specified by another object. Specifically, if "this" and "new" are
*     of the same class, a copy of "this" is returned. If "this" is an
*     instance of a subclass of "obj", then a copy of the component
*     of "this" that matches the class of "obj" is returned. Otherwise,
*     a NULL pointer is returned without error.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the Object to be cast.
*     obj
*        Pointer to an Object that defines the class of the returned Object.
*        The returned Object will be of the same class as "obj".

*  Returned Value:
*     A pointer to the new Object. NULL if "this" is not a sub-class of
*     "obj", or if an error occurs.

*  Notes:
*     - A NULL pointer will be returned if this function is invoked
*     with the global error status set, or if it should fail for any
*     reason.

*     method inherited fromm the Frame class).

*  Description:
*     This function compares two Regions and determines whether it
*     is possible to convert between the coordinate systems which
*     their current Frames represent. If conversion is possible, it
*     returns a FrameSet which describes the conversion and which may
*     be used (as a Mapping) to transform coordinate values in either
*     direction.

*  Parameters:
*     from
*        Pointer to a Region whose current Frame represents the
*        "source" coordinate system.  Note that the Base attribute of
*        the Region may be modified by this function.
*     to
*        Pointer to a Region whose current Frame represents the
*        "destination" coordinate system.  Note that the Base
*        attribute of the Region may be modified by this function.
*     domainlist
*        Pointer to a null-terminated character string containing a
*        comma-separated list of Frame domains. This may be used to
*        define a priority order for the different intermediate
*        coordinate systems that might be used to perform the
*        conversion.
*
*        The function will first try to obtain a conversion by making
*        use only of intermediate Frames whose Domain attribute
*        matches the first domain in this list. If this fails, the
*        second domain in the list will be used, and so on, until
*        conversion is achieved. A blank domain (e.g. two consecutive
*        commas) indicates that all Frames should be considered,
*        regardless of their Domain attributes. The list is
*        case-insensitive and all white space is ignored.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*        If the requested coordinate conversion is possible, the
*        function returns a pointer to a FrameSet which describes the
*        conversion. Otherwise, a null Object pointer (AST__NULL) is
*        returned without error.
*
*        If a FrameSet is returned, it will contain two Frames. Frame
*        number 1 (its base Frame) will describe the source coordinate
*        system, corresponding to the "from" parameter. Frame number 2
*        (its current Frame) will describe the destination coordinate
*        system, corresponding to the "to" parameter. The Mapping
*        which inter-relates these Frames will perform the required
*        conversion between the two coordinate systems.

*  Notes:
*     - The returned FrameSet will not contain any Regions. If one or
*     more of the supplied Frames are in fact Regions, the corresponding
*     Frames in any returned FrameSet will described the encapsulated
*     Frame, without any region information.
*     - A NULL pointer will be returned if this function is invoked
*     with the global error status set, or if it should fail for any
*     reason.

*  Class Membership:
*     Region member function (over-rides the astFindFrame method
*     inherited from the Frame class).

*  Description:
*     This function uses a "template" Frame to search a Region to
*     identify a coordinate system which has a specified set of
*     characteristics. If a suitable coordinate system can be found,
*     the function returns a pointer to a FrameSet which describes the
*     required coordinate system and how to convert coordinates to and
*     from it.

*  Parameters:
*     target
*        Pointer to the target Region.
*     template
*        Pointer to the template Frame, which should be an instance of
*        the type of Frame you wish to find.
*     domainlist
*        Pointer to a null-terminated character string containing a
*        comma-separated list of Frame domains. This may be used to
*        establish a priority order for the different types of
*        coordinate system that might be found.
*
*        The function will first try to find a suitable coordinate
*        system whose Domain attribute equals the first domain in this
*        list. If this fails, the second domain in the list will be
*        used, and so on, until a result is obtained. A blank domain
*        (e.g. two consecutive commas) indicates that any coordinate
*        system is acceptable (subject to the template) regardless of
*        its domain.
*
*        This list is case-insensitive and all white space is ignored.
*        If you do not wish to restrict the domain in this way, you
*        should supply an empty string.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     If the search is successful, the function returns a pointer to a
*     FrameSet which contains the Frame found and a description of how
*     to convert to (and from) the coordinate system it
*     represents. Otherwise, a null Object pointer (AST__NULL) is
*     returned without error.
*
*     If a FrameSet is returned, it will contain two Frames. Frame
*     number 1 (its base Frame) represents the target coordinate
*     system and will be the same as the target. Frame number 2 (its
*     current Frame) will be a Frame representing the coordinate system
*     which the function found. The Mapping which inter-relates these two
*     Frames will describe how to convert between their respective coordinate
*     systems. Note, the Frames in this FrameSet will not be Regions -
*     that is, they will be simple Frames or other derived classes.

*  Notes:
*     - A null Object pointer (AST__NULL) will be returned if this
*     function is invoked with the AST error status set, or if it
*     should fail for any reason.

*  Returned Value:
c     astGetUnc()
f     AST_GETUNC = INTEGER
*        A pointer to a Region describing the uncertainty in the supplied
*        Region.

*  Applicability:
*     CmpRegion
*        The default uncertainty for a CmpRegion is taken from one of the
*        two component Regions. If the first component Region has a
*        non-default uncertainty, then it is used as the default uncertainty
*        for the parent CmpRegion. Otherwise, if the second component Region
*        has a non-default uncertainty, then it is used as the default
*        uncertainty for the parent CmpRegion. If neither of the
*        component Regions has non-default uncertainty, then the default
*        uncertainty for the CmpRegion is 1.0E-6 of the bounding box of
*        the CmpRegion.
*     Prism
*        The default uncertainty for a Prism is formed by combining the
*        uncertainties from the two component Regions. If a component
*        Region does not have a non-default uncertainty, then its default
*        uncertainty will be used to form the default uncertainty of the
*        parent Prism.
*     Region
*        For other classes of Region, the default uncertainty is 1.0E-6
*        of the bounding box of the Region. If the bounding box has zero
*        width on any axis, then the uncertainty will be 1.0E-6 of the
*        axis value.

*  Notes:
*     - If uncertainty information is associated with a Region, and the
*     coordinate system described by the Region is subsequently changed
*     (e.g. by changing the value of its System attribute, or using the
c     astMapRegion
f     AST_MAPREGION
*     function), then the uncertainty information returned by this function
*     will be modified so that it refers to the coordinate system currently
*     described by the supplied Region.

f     function is invoked with STATUS set to an error value, or if it
c     - A null Object pointer (NULL) will be returned if this
c     function is invoked with the AST error status set, or if it

*     with the global error status set, or if it should fail for any

*  Description:
*     This function finds the coordinate values at the point of
*     intersection between two geodesic curves. Each curve is specified
*     by two points on the curve.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the SkyFrame.
*     a1
*        An array of double, with one element for each Frame axis.
*        This should contain the coordinates of a point on the first
*        geodesic curve.
*     a2
*        An array of double, with one element for each Frame axis.
*        This should contain the coordinates of a second point on the
*        first geodesic curve.
*     b1
*        An array of double, with one element for each Frame axis.
*        This should contain the coordinates of a point on the second
*        geodesic curve.
*     b2
*        An array of double, with one element for each Frame axis.
*        This should contain the coordinates of a second point on
*        the second geodesic curve.
*     cross
*        An array of double, with one element for each Frame axis
*        in which the coordinates of the required intersection
*        point will be returned. These will be AST__BAD if the curves do
*        not intersect.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Notes:
*     - The geodesic curve used by this function is the path of
*     shortest distance between two points, as defined by the
*     astDistance function.
*     - This function will return "bad" coordinate values (AST__BAD)
*     if any of the input coordinates has this value.
*     - For SkyFrames each curve will be a great circle, and in general
*     each pair of curves will intersect at two diametrically opposite
*     points on the sky. The returned position is the one which is
*     closest to point "a1".

*  Description:

*  Description:
*     This function determines if the two suplied line segments cross,

*     A flag is also returned indicating if the crossing point occurs
*     within the length of both line segments, or outside one or both of
*     the line segments.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the Frame.
*     l1
*        Pointer to the structure defining the first line.
*     l2
*        Pointer to the structure defining the second line.
*     cross
*        Pointer to an array in which to return the axis values at the

*        lines are parallel (i.e. do not cross) then AST__BAD is returned for
*        all axis values. Note usable axis values are returned even if the
*        lines cross outside the segment defined by the start and end points
*        of the lines. The order of axes in the returned array will take
*        account of the current axis permutation array if appropriate. Note,
*        sub-classes such as SkyFrame may append extra values to the end
*        of the basic frame axis values.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     A non-zero value is returned if the lines cross at a point which is
*     within the [start,end) segment of both lines. If the crossing point
*     is outside this segment on either line, or if the lines are parallel,
*     zero is returned. Note, the start point is considered to be inside
*     the length of the segment, but the end point is outside.

*  Notes:
*     - The pointers supplied for "l1" and "l2" should have been created
*     using the astLineDef method. These structures contained cached

*++
*  Name:
c     astMask<X>
f     AST_MASK<X>

*  Purpose:
*     Mask a region of a data grid.

*  Type:
*     Public virtual function.

*  Synopsis:
c     #include "region.h"
c     int astMask<X>( AstRegion *this, AstMapping *map, int inside, int ndim,
c                     const int lbnd[], const int ubnd[], <Xtype> in[],
c                     <Xtype> val )
f     RESULT = AST_MASK<X>( THIS, MAP, INSIDE, NDIM, LBND, UBND, IN, VAL,
f                           STATUS )

*  Class Membership:
*     Mapping method.

*  Description:
*     This is a set of functions for masking out regions within gridded data
*     (e.g. an image). The functions modifies a given data grid by
*     assigning a specified value to all samples which are inside (or outside
c     if "inside" is zero)
f     if INSIDE is .FALSE.)
*     the specified Region.
*
*     You should use a masking function which matches the numerical
*     type of the data you are processing by replacing <X> in
c     the generic function name astMask<X> by an appropriate 1- or
f     the generic function name AST_MASK<X> by an appropriate 1- or
*     2-character type code. For example, if you are masking data
c     with type "float", you should use the function astMaskF (see
f     with type REAL, you should use the function AST_MASKR (see
*     the "Data Type Codes" section below for the codes appropriate to
*     other numerical types).

*  Parameters:
c     this
f     THIS = INTEGER (Given)
*        Pointer to a Region.
c     map
f     MAP = INTEGER (Given)
*        Pointer to a Mapping. The forward transformation should map
*        positions in the coordinate system of the supplied Region
*        into pixel coordinates as defined by the
c        "lbnd" and "ubnd" parameters. A NULL pointer
f        LBND and UBND arguments. A value of AST__NULL
*        can be supplied if the coordinate system of the supplied Region
*        corresponds to pixel coordinates. This is equivalent to
*        supplying a UnitMap.
*
*        The number of inputs for this Mapping (as given by its Nin attribute)
*        should match the number of axes in the supplied Region (as given
*        by the Naxes attribute of the Region).
*        The number of outputs for the Mapping (as given by its Nout attribute)
*        should match the number of
c        grid dimensions given by the value of "ndim"
f        grid dimensions given by the value of NDIM
*        below.
c     inside
f     INSIDE = INTEGER (Given)
*        A boolean value which indicates which pixel are to be masked. If
c        a non-zero value
f        .TRUE.
*        is supplied, then all grid pixels with centres inside the supplied
*        Region are assigned the value given by
c        "val",
f        VAL,
*        and all other pixels are left unchanged. If
c        zero
f        .FALSE.
*        is supplied, then all grid pixels with centres not inside the supplied
*        Region are assigned the value given by
c        "val",
f        VAL,
*        and all other pixels are left unchanged. Note, the Negated
*        attribute of the Region is used to determine which pixel are
*        inside the Region and which are outside. So the inside of a Region
*        which has not been negated is the same as the outside of the
*        corresponding negated Region.
*
*        For types of Region such as PointList which have zero volume,
*        pixel centres will rarely fall exactly within the Region. For
*        this reason, the inclusion criterion is changed for zero-volume
*        Regions so that pixels are included (or excluded) if any part of
*        the Region passes through the pixel. For a PointList, this means
*        that pixels are included (or excluded) if they contain at least
*        one of the points listed in the PointList.
c     ndim
f     NDIM = INTEGER (Given)
*        The number of dimensions in the input grid. This should be at
*        least one.
c     lbnd
f     LBND( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Given)
c        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim" elements,
f        An array
*        containing the coordinates of the centre of the first pixel
*        in the input grid along each dimension.
c     ubnd
f     UBND( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Given)
c        Pointer to an array of integers, with "ndim" elements,
f        An array
*        containing the coordinates of the centre of the last pixel in
*        the input grid along each dimension.
*
c        Note that "lbnd" and "ubnd" together define the shape
f        Note that LBND and UBND together define the shape
*        and size of the input grid, its extent along a particular
c        (j'th) dimension being ubnd[j]-lbnd[j]+1 (assuming the
c        index "j" to be zero-based). They also define
f        (J'th) dimension being UBND(J)-LBND(J)+1. They also define
*        the input grid's coordinate system, each pixel having unit
*        extent along each dimension with integral coordinate values
*        at its centre.
c     in
f     IN( * ) = <Xtype> (Given and Returned)
c        Pointer to an array, with one element for each pixel in the
f        An array, with one element for each pixel in the
*        input grid, containing the data to be masked.  The
*        numerical type of this array should match the 1- or
*        2-character type code appended to the function name (e.g. if
c        you are using astMaskF, the type of each array element
c        should be "float").
f        you are using AST_MASKR, the type of each array element
f        should be REAL).
*
*        The storage order of data within this array should be such
*        that the index of the first grid dimension varies most
*        rapidly and that of the final dimension least rapidly
c        (i.e. Fortran array indexing is used).
f        (i.e. normal Fortran array storage order).
*
*        On exit, the samples specified by
c        "inside" are set to the value of "val".
f        INSIDE are set to the value of VAL.
*        All other samples are left unchanged.
c     val
f     VAL = <Xtype> (Given)
*        This argument should have the same type as the elements of
c        the "in" array. It specifies the value used to flag the
f        the IN array. It specifies the value used to flag the
*        masked data (see
c        "inside").
f        INSIDE).
f     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
f        The global status.

*  Returned Value:
c     astMask<X>()
f     AST_MASK<X> = INTEGER
*        The number of pixels to which a value of
c        "badval"
f        BADVAL
*        has been assigned.

*  Notes:
*     - A value of zero will be returned if this function is invoked
*     with the global error status set, or if it should fail for any
*     reason.
*     - An error will be reported if the overlap of the Region and
*     the array cannot be determined.

*  Data Type Codes:
*     To select the appropriate masking function, you should
c     replace <X> in the generic function name astMask<X> with a
f     replace <X> in the generic function name AST_MASK<X> with a
*     1- or 2-character data type code, so as to match the numerical
*     type <Xtype> of the data you are processing, as follows:
c     - D: double
c     - F: float
c     - L: long int
c     - UL: unsigned long int
c     - I: int
c     - UI: unsigned int
c     - S: short int
c     - US: unsigned short int
c     - B: byte (signed char)
c     - UB: unsigned byte (unsigned char)
f     - D: DOUBLE PRECISION
f     - R: REAL
f     - I: INTEGER
f     - UI: INTEGER (treated as unsigned)
f     - S: INTEGER*2 (short integer)
f     - US: INTEGER*2 (short integer, treated as unsigned)
f     - B: BYTE (treated as signed)
f     - UB: BYTE (treated as unsigned)
*
c     For example, astMaskD would be used to process "double"
c     data, while astMaskS would be used to process "short int"
c     data, etc.
f     For example, AST_MASKD would be used to process DOUBLE
f     PRECISION data, while AST_MASKS would be used to process
f     short integer data (stored in an INTEGER*2 array), etc.
f
f     For compatibility with other Starlink facilities, the codes W
f     and UW are provided as synonyms for S and US respectively (but
f     only in the Fortran interface to AST).

*  Handling of Huge Pixel Arrays:
*     If the input grid is so large that an integer pixel index,
*     (or a count of pixels) could exceed the largest value that can be
*     represented by a 4-byte integer, then the alternative "8-byte"
*     interface for this function should be used. This alternative interface
*     uses 8 byte integer arguments (instead of 4-byte) to hold pixel
*     indices and pixel counts. Specifically, the arguments
c     "lbnd" and "ubnd" are
c     changed from type "int" to type "int64_t" (defined in header file
c     stdint.h). The function return type is similarly changed to type
c     int64_t.
f     LBND, UBND are changed from
f     type INTEGER to type INTEGER*8. The function return type is similarly
f     changed to type INTEGER*8.
*     The function name is changed by inserting the digit "8" before the
*     trailing data type code. Thus,
c     astMask<X> becomes astMask8<X>.
f     AST_MASK<X> becomes AST_MASK8<X>.

/*
*  Name:
*     Match

*  Purpose:
*     Determine if conversion is possible between two coordinate systems.

*  Type:
*     Private function.

*  Synopsis:
*     #include "region.h"
*     int Match( AstFrame *template, AstFrame *target, int matchsub,
*                int **template_axes, int **target_axes,
*                AstMapping **map, AstFrame **result, int *status )

*  Class Membership:
*     Region member function (over-rides the protected astMatch
*     method inherited from the Frame class).

*  Description:
*     This function matches the current Frame of a "template" Region
*     to a "target" frame and determines whether it is possible to
*     convert coordinates between them.  If it is, a Mapping that
*     performs the transformation is returned along with a new Frame
*     that describes the coordinate system that results when this
*     Mapping is applied to the current Frame of the target
*     Region. In addition, information is returned to allow the axes
*     in this "result" Frame to be associated with the corresponding
*     axes in the target and template Frames from which they are
*     derived.

*  Parameters:
*     template
*        Pointer to the template Region, whose current Frame
*        describes the coordinate system (or set of possible
*        coordinate systems) into which we wish to convert our
*        coordinates.
*     target
*        Pointer to the target Frame. This describes the coordinate
*        system in which we already have coordinates.
*     matchsub
*        If zero then a match only occurs if the template is of the same
*        class as the target, or of a more specialised class. If non-zero
*        then a match can occur even if this is not the case.
*     template_axes
*        Address of a location where a pointer to int will be returned
*        if the requested coordinate conversion is possible. This
*        pointer will point at a dynamically allocated array of
*        integers with one element for each axis of the "result" Frame
*        (see below). It must be freed by the caller (using astFree)
*        when no longer required.
*
*        For each axis in the result Frame, the corresponding element
*        of this array will return the index of the axis in the
*        template Region's current Frame from which it is
*        derived. If it is not derived from any template Region
*        axis, a value of -1 will be returned instead.
*     target_axes
*        Address of a location where a pointer to int will be returned
*        if the requested coordinate conversion is possible. This
*        pointer will point at a dynamically allocated array of
*        integers with one element for each axis of the "result" Frame
*        (see below). It must be freed by the caller (using astFree)
*        when no longer required.
*
*        For each axis in the result Frame, the corresponding element
*        of this array will return the index of the target Frame axis
*        from which it is derived. If it is not derived from any
*        target Frame axis, a value of -1 will be returned instead.
*     map
*        Address of a location where a pointer to a new Mapping will
*        be returned if the requested coordinate conversion is
*        possible. If returned, the forward transformation of this
*        Mapping may be used to convert coordinates between the target
*        Frame and the result Frame (see below) and the inverse
*        transformation will convert in the opposite direction.
*     result
*        Address of a location where a pointer to a new Frame will be
*        returned if the requested coordinate conversion is
*        possible. If returned, this Frame describes the coordinate
*        system that results from applying the returned Mapping
*        (above) to the "target" coordinate system. In general, this
*        Frame will combine attributes from (and will therefore be
*        more specific than) both the target Frame and the current
*        Frame of the template Region. In particular, when the
*        template allows the possibility of transformaing to any one
*        of a set of alternative coordinate systems, the "result"
*        Frame will indicate which of the alternatives was used.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     A non-zero value is returned if the requested coordinate
*     conversion is possible. Otherwise zero is returned (this will
*     not in itself result in an error condition).

*  Notes:
*     - A value of zero will be returned if this function is invoked
*     with the global error status set, or if it should fail for any
*     reason.

*  Class Membership:

*  Description:
*     This function modifies a supplied box to include the effect of any
*     singularities in the co-ordinate system represented by the Frame.
*     For a normal Cartesian coordinate system, the box will be returned
*     unchanged. Other classes of Frame may do other things. For instance,
*     a SkyFrame will check to see if the box contains either the north
*     or south pole and extend the box appropriately.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the Frame.
*     lbnd
*        An array of double, with one element for each Frame axis
*        (Naxes attribute). Initially, this should contain a set of
*        lower axis bounds for the box. They will be modified on exit
*        to include the effect of any singularities within the box.
*     ubnd
*        An array of double, with one element for each Frame axis
*        (Naxes attribute). Initially, this should contain a set of
*        upper axis bounds for the box. They will be modified on exit
*        to include the effect of any singularities within the box.
*     reg
*        A Mapping which should be used to test if any singular points are
*        inside or outside the box. The Mapping should leave an input
*        position unchanged if the point is inside the box, and should
*        set all bad if the point is outside the box.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*     offset
*        The required offset from the first point along the geodesic

*  Class Membership:
*     Region member function (over-rides the protected astOffset2

*  Description:
*     This function finds the Frame coordinate values of a point which
*     is offset a specified distance along the geodesic curve at a
*     given angle from a specified starting point. It can only be
*     used with 2-dimensional Frames.
*
*     For example, in a basic Frame, this offset will be along the
*     straight line joining two points. For a more specialised Frame
*     describing a sky coordinate system, however, it would be along
*     the great circle passing through two sky positions.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the Frame.
*     point1
*        An array of double, with one element for each Frame axis
*        (Naxes attribute). This should contain the coordinates of the
*        point marking the start of the geodesic curve.
*     angle
*        The angle (in radians) from the positive direction of the second
*        axis, to the direction of the required position, as seen from
*        the starting position. Positive rotation is in the sense of
*        rotation from the positive direction of axis 2 to the positive
*        direction of axis 1.
*     offset
*        The required offset from the first point along the geodesic
*        curve. If this is positive, it will be in the direction of the
*        given angle. If it is negative, it will be in the opposite
*        direction.
*     point2
*        An array of double, with one element for each Frame axis
*        in which the coordinates of the required point will be returned.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     The direction of the geodesic curve at the end point. That is, the
*     angle (in radians) between the positive direction of the second
*     axis and the continuation of the geodesic curve at the requested
*     end point. Positive rotation is in the sense of rotation from
*     the positive direction of axis 2 to the positive direction of axis 1.

*  Notes:
*     - The geodesic curve used by this function is the path of
*     shortest distance between two points, as defined by the
*     astDistance function.
*     - An error will be reported if the Frame is not 2-dimensional.
*     - This function will return "bad" coordinate values (AST__BAD)
*     if any of the input coordinates has this value.

*  Class Membership:

*  Description:
*     This function returns an integer value indicating if the two
*     supplied Regions overlap. The two Regions are converted to a commnon
*     coordinate system before performing the check. If this conversion is
*     not possible (for instance because the two Regions represent areas in
*     different domains), then the check cannot be performed and a zero value
*     is returned to indicate this.

*  Parameters:
c     this
f     THIS = INTEGER (Given)
*        Pointer to the first Region.
c     that
f     THAT = INTEGER (Given)
*        Pointer to the second Region.

f        The global status.

*  Returned Value:
c     astOverlap()
f     AST_OVERLAP = INTEGER
*        A value indicating if there is any overlap between the two Regions.
*        Possible values are:
*
*        0 - The check could not be performed because the second Region
*            could not be mapped into the coordinate system of the first
*            Region.
*
*        1 - There is no overlap between the two Regions.
*
*        2 - The first Region is completely inside the second Region.
*
*        3 - The second Region is completely inside the first Region.
*
*        4 - There is partial overlap between the two Regions.
*
*        5 - The Regions are identical to within their uncertainties.
*
*        6 - The second Region is the exact negation of the first Region
*            to within their uncertainties.

*  Notes:
*     - The returned values 5 and 6 do not check the value of the Closed
*     attribute in the two Regions.
*     - A value of zero will be returned if this function is invoked with the
*     AST error status set, or if it should fail for any reason.
*--

* Implementation Notes:
*    This function is simply a wrap-up for the protected astOverlapX

*    to be over-ridden by derived classes on the basis of the class of either

*     void Overlay( AstFrame *template, const int *template_axes,

*  Class Membership:
*     Region member function (over-rides the protected astOverlay
*     method inherited from the Frame class).

*  Description:
*     This function overlays attributes from the current Frame of a
*     Region on to another Frame, so as to over-ride selected
*     attributes of that second Frame. Normally only those attributes
*     which have been specifically set in the template will be
*     transferred. This implements a form of defaulting, in which a
*     Frame acquires attributes from the template, but retains its
*     original attributes (as the default) if new values have not
*     previously been explicitly set in the template.

*  Parameters:
*     template
*        Pointer to the template Region, for whose current Frame
*        values should have been explicitly set for any attribute
*        which is to be transferred.
*     template_axes
*        Pointer to an array of int, with one element for each axis of
*        the "result" Frame (see below). For each axis in the result
*        frame, the corresponding element of this array should contain
*        the (zero-based) index of the axis in the current Frame of
*        the template Region to which it corresponds. This array is
*        used to establish from which template Frame axis any
*        axis-dependent attributes should be obtained.
*
*        If any axis in the result Frame is not associated with a
*        template Frame axis, the corresponding element of this array
*        should be set to -1.
*
*        If a NULL pointer is supplied, the template and result axis
*        indices are assumed to be identical.

*  Parameters:
*     this

*     perm
*        An array of int (with one element for each axis of the

*  Notes:

*  Description:
*     This function creates a new Frame whose axes are copies of axes
*     picked from the encapsulated Frame of an existing Region. Other
*     Frame attributes are also copied from this existing Frame to the
*     new Frame. Zero or more of the original axes may be picked in

*     required.
*
*     Optionally, a Mapping that converts between the original Frame's
*     axes and those of the new Frame may also be returned.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the Region.
*     naxes
*        The number of axes required in the new Frame.
*     axes
*        Pointer to an array of int with naxes elements. This should
*        contain (zero based) axis indices specifying the axes which
*        are to be included in the new Frame, in the order
*        required. Each axis index may occur only once.
*
*        If additional (default) axes are also to be included, the
*        corresponding elements of this array should be set to -1.
*     map
*        Address of a location to receive a pointer to a new
*        Mapping. This will be a PermMap (or a UnitMap as a special
*        case) that describes the axis permutation that has taken
*        place between the current Frame of the Region and the new
*        Frame.  The forward transformation will convert from the
*        original Region's axes to the new one's, and vice versa.
*
*        If this Mapping is not required, a NULL value may be supplied
*        for this parameter.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     Pointer to the new Frame.

*  Notes:
*     - The class of object returned may differ from that of the
*     original current Frame, depending on which axes are
*     selected. For example, if a single axis is picked from a
*     SkyFrame (which always has two axes), the resulting Frame cannot
*     be a valid SkyFrame, so will revert to the parent class (Frame)
*     instead.
*     - The new Frame contains a deep copy of all the data selected
*     from the original current Frame. Modifying the new Frame will
*     therefore not affect the Region or the Frames it contains.
*     - A NULL pointer will be returned if this function is invoked
*     with the global error status set, or if it should fail for any
*     reason.

*     Region virtual function.

*  Description:
*     This function returns a flag indicating if the supplied Region has
*     a dummy FrameSet.
*
*     The astDump method for a Region may choose not to include the
*     Region's FrameSet in the dump, depending on the value of the
*     RegionFS attribute and the nature of the FrameSet. If the FrameSet
*     is omitted from the Dump, then special action has to be taken when
*     the dump is subsequently read in and used to re-create the Region.
*     On encounterting such a dump, the astLoadRegion function will create
*     a dummy FrameSet and associate it with the reconstructed  Region.
*     The new Region should not be used however until this dummy FrameSet
*     has been replaced by the correct FrameSet. Performing this replacement
*     is the responsibility of the parent class (i.e. the class which choose
*     to omit the FrameSet from the dump). These will usually be Region
*     classes which encapsulate other Regions, such as CmpRegion, Prism,
*     Stc, etc.
*
*     This function can be used by astLoad... methods in sub-classes to
*     determine if a newly loaded component Region has a dummy FrameSet. If
*     so the astLoad function should either use the astSetRegFS method to
*     store a new FrameSet in the component Region. If the parent Region
*     itself has a dummy FrameSet (i.e. is a component Region contained
*     within a higher level Region) then it cannot do this and should
*     ignore the presence of the dummy FrameSet (it then becomes the
*     responsibility of hte parent Region to load appropriate FrameSets
*     into all its components).

*        Pointer to the Region.
*     lbnd
*        Pointer to an array in which to return the lower axis bounds
*        covered by the Region. It should have at least as many elements

*        Pointer to an array in which to return the upper axis bounds
*        covered by the Region. It should have at least as many elements

*  Notes:
*    - The value of the Negated attribute is ignored (i.e. it is assumed that

*  Description:

c     surface
f     SURFACE = LOGICAL (Given)
c        If non-zero,
f        If .TRUE.,
*        the returned points will cover the surface or the Region.
*        Otherwise, they will fill the interior of the Region.
c     maxpoint
f     MAXPOINT = INTEGER (Given)
*        If zero, the number of points in the mesh is returned in
c        "*npoint",
f        NPOINT,
*        but no axis values are returned and all other parameters are ignored.
*        If not zero, the supplied value should be the length of the
c        second dimension of the "points"
f        first dimension of the POINTS
*        array. An error is reported if the number of points in the mesh
*        exceeds this number.

*        An error is reported if the number of axes in the supplied Region
*        exceeds this number.
c     npoint
f     NPOINT = INTEGER (Returned)
c        A pointer to an integer in which to return the
f        The
*        number of points in the returned mesh.
c     points
f     POINTS( MAXPOINT, MAXCOORD ) = DOUBLE PRECISION (Returned)
c        The address of the first element in a 2-dimensional array of
c        shape "[maxcoord][maxpoint]", in which to return the coordinate
c        values at the mesh positions. These are stored such that the
c        value of coordinate number "coord" for point number "point" is
c        found in element "points[coord][point]".
f        An array in which to return the coordinates values at the mesh
f        positions. These are stored such that the value of coordinate
f        number COORD for point number POINT is found in element
f        POINTS(POINT,COORD).
f     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
f        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     - An error is reported if the Region is unbounded.
*     - If the coordinate system represented by the Region has been
*     changed since it was first created, the returned axis values refer
*     to the new (changed) coordinate system, rather than the original
*     coordinate system. Note however that if the transformation from
*     original to new coordinate system is non-linear, the shape within
*     the new coordinate system may be distorted, and so may not match
*     that implied by the name of the Region subclass (Circle, Box, etc).

*        on the CmpRegion.
*     Ellipse
*        The first returned position is the Ellipse centre. The second is
*        the end of one of the axes of the ellipse. The third is some
*        other point on the circumference of the ellipse, distinct from

*     Polygon
*        The positions returned are the vertex positions that were supplied
*        when the Polygon was constructed.
*     Prism
*        Returns a value of zero for
c        "*npoint"
f        NPOINT

*  Name:

*     AstPointSet *ResolvePoints( AstFrame *this, const double point1[],

*                                 AstPointSet *out )

*  Class Membership:
*     Region member function (over-rides the astResolvePoints method
*     inherited from the Frame class).

*  Description:
*     This function takes a Frame and a set of vectors encapsulated
*     in a PointSet, and resolves each one into two orthogonal components,
*     returning these two components in another PointSet.
*
*     This is exactly the same as the public astResolve method, except
*     that this method allows many vectors to be processed in a single call,
*     thus reducing the computational cost of overheads of many
*     individual calls to astResolve.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the Frame.
*     point1
*        An array of double, with one element for each Frame axis
*        (Naxes attribute). This marks the start of the basis vector,
*        and of the vectors to be resolved.
*     point2
*        An array of double, with one element for each Frame axis
*        (Naxes attribute). This marks the end of the basis vector.
*     in
*        Pointer to the PointSet holding the ends of the vectors to be
*        resolved.
*     out
*        Pointer to a PointSet which will hold the length of the two
*        resolved components. A NULL value may also be given, in which
*        case a new PointSet will be created by this function.

*  Returned Value:
*     Pointer to the output (possibly new) PointSet. The first axis will
*     hold the lengths of the vector components parallel to the basis vector.
*     These values will be signed (positive values are in the same sense as
*     movement from point 1 to point 2. The second axis will hold the lengths
*     of the vector components perpendicular to the basis vector. These
*     values will always be positive.

*  Notes:
*     - The number of coordinate values per point in the input
*     PointSet must match the number of axes in the supplied Frame.
*     - If an output PointSet is supplied, it must have space for
*     sufficient number of points and 2 coordinate values per point.
*     - A null pointer will be returned if this function is invoked
*     with the global error status set, or if it should fail for any
*     reason.

*  Name:

*  Type:

*     AstMapping *Simplify( AstMapping *this, int *status )

*  Class Membership:
*     Region method (over-rides the astSimplify method inherited

*  Description:
*     This function simplifies the encapsulated FrameSet and any
*     uncertainty Region in the supplied Region. This is different to
*     the Simplify method in the parent Frame class which always returns
*     a UnitMap.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the original Region.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     A pointer to the simplified Region. A cloned pointer to the
*     supplied Region will be returned if no simplication could be
*     performed.

*  Notes:
*     - This implementation just simplifies the encapsulated FrameSet
*     and uncertainty Region. Sub-classes should usually provide their own
*     implementation which invokes this implemetation, and then continues to
*     check for further simplifications (such as fitting a new region to the
*     current Frame).
*     - A NULL pointer value will be returned if this function is
*     invoked with the AST error status set, or if it should fail for
*     any reason.

*  Type:

*     #include "region.h"
*     int SubFrame( AstFrame *target, AstFrame *template, int result_naxes,
*                   const int *target_axes, const int *template_axes,
*                   AstMapping **map, AstFrame **result, int *status )

*  Class Membership:
*     Region member function (over-rides the protected astSubFrame
*     method inherited from the Frame class).

*  Description:
*     This function selects a requested sub-set (or super-set) of the
*     axes from the current Frame of a "target" Region and creates a
*     new Frame with copies of the selected axes assembled in the
*     requested order. It then optionally overlays the attributes of a
*     "template" Frame on to the result. It returns both the resulting
*     Frame and a Mapping that describes how to convert between the
*     coordinate systems described by the current Frame of the target
*     Region and the result Frame. If necessary, this Mapping takes
*     account of any differences in the Frames' attributes due to the
*     influence of the template.

*  Parameters:
*     target
*        Pointer to the target Region, from whose current Frame the
*        axes are to be selected.
*     template
*        Pointer to the template Frame, from which new attributes for
*        the result Frame are to be obtained. Optionally, this may be
*        NULL, in which case no overlaying of template attributes will
*        be performed.
*     result_naxes
*        Number of axes to be selected from the target Region. This
*        number may be greater than or less than the number of axes in
*        the Region's current Frame (or equal).
*     target_axes
*        Pointer to an array of int with result_naxes elements, giving
*        a list of the (zero-based) axis indices of the axes to be
*        selected from the current Frame of the target Region. The
*        order in which these are given determines the order in which
*        the axes appear in the result Frame. If any of the values in
*        this array is set to -1, the corresponding result axis will
*        not be derived from the target Region, but will be assigned
*        default attributes instead.
*     template_axes
*        Pointer to an array of int with result_naxes elements. This
*        should contain a list of the template axes (given as
*        zero-based axis indices) with which the axes of the result
*        Frame are to be associated. This array determines which axes
*        are used when overlaying axis-dependent attributes of the
*        template on to the result. If any element of this array is
*        set to -1, the corresponding result axis will not receive any
*        template attributes.
*
*        If the template argument is given as NULL, this array is not
*        used and a NULL pointer may also be supplied here.
*     map
*        Address of a location to receive a pointer to the returned
*        Mapping.  The forward transformation of this Mapping will
*        describe how to convert coordinates from the coordinate
*        system described by the current Frame of the target Region
*        to that described by the result Frame. The inverse
*        transformation will convert in the opposite direction.
*     result
*        Address of a location to receive a pointer to the result Frame.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     A non-zero value is returned if coordinate conversion is
*     possible between the current Frame of the target Region and
*     the result Frame. Otherwise zero is returned and *map and
*     *result are returned as NULL (but this will not in itself result
*     in an error condition). In general, coordinate conversion should
*     always be possible if no template Frame is supplied but may not
*     always be possible otherwise.

*  Notes:
*     - A value of zero will be returned if this function is invoked
*     with the global error status set, or if it should fail for any
*     reason.

*     It also returned a pointer to either the current or base Frame in

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the Region.
*     in
*        Pointer to the PointSet holding the input coordinate data. If
*        NULL then the "points" PointSet within the supplied Region
*        ("this") is used.
*     forward
*        A non-zero value indicates that the forward coordinate transformation
*        (from base to current) should be applied, while a zero value requests
*        the inverse transformation (from current to base).
*     out
*        Pointer to a PointSet which will hold the transformed (output)
*        coordinate values. A NULL value may also be given, in which case a
*        new PointSet will be created by this function.
*     frm
*        Location at which to return a pointer to a Frame. If "forward"
*        is non-zero, the current Frame in the encapsulated FrameSet will
*        be returned. Otherwise, the base Frame is returned. The returned
*        pointer should be annulled when no longer needed. May be NULL if
*        no pointer is needed.

*  Returned Value:
*     Pointer to the output (possibly new) PointSet. If "out" is NULL,
*     the returned pointer will be a clone of "in" if the Mapping is a
*     UnitMap. If "out" is not NULL, then the supplied "out" PointSet will
*     be used and returned.

*  Notes:
*     - An error will result if the Region supplied does not define
*     the requested coordinate transformation (either forward or
*     inverse).
*     - The number of coordinate values per point in the input
*     PointSet must match the number of input coordinates for the
*     Region being applied (or number of output coordinates if the
*     inverse transformation is requested).  This will be equal to the
*     number of axes in the Region's base Frame (or the current
*     Frame for the inverse transformation).
*     - If an output PointSet is supplied, it must have space for
*     sufficient number of points and coordinate values per point to
*     accommodate the result (e.g. the number of Region output
*     coordinates, or number of input coordinates if the inverse
*     transformation is requested). Any excess space will be ignored.
*     - A null pointer will be returned if this function is invoked
*     with the global error status set, or if it should fail for any
*     reason.

/*
*att++
*  Name:
*     Adaptive

*  Purpose:
*     Should the area adapt to changes in the coordinate system?

*  Type:
*     Public attribute.

*  Synopsis:
*     Integer (boolean).

*  Description:
*     The coordinate system represented by a Region may be changed by
*     assigning new values to attributes such as System, Unit, etc.
*     For instance, a Region representing an area on the sky in ICRS
*     coordinates may have its System attribute changed so that it
*     represents (say) Galactic coordinates instead of ICRS. This
*     attribute controls what happens when the coordinate system
*     represented by a Region is changed in this way.
*
*     If Adaptive is non-zero (the default), then the area represented by
*     the Region adapts to the new coordinate system. That is, the numerical
*     values which define the area represented by the Region are changed
*     by mapping them from the old coordinate system into the new coordinate
*     system. Thus the Region continues to represent the same physical
*     area.
*
*     If Adaptive is zero, then area represented by the Region does not adapt
*     to the new coordinate system. That is, the numerical values which
*     define the area represented by the Region are left unchanged. Thus
*     the physical area represented by the Region will usually change.
*
*     As an example, consider a Region describe a range of wavelength from
*     2000 Angstrom to 4000 Angstrom. If the Unit attribute for the Region
*     is changed from Angstrom to "nm" (nanometre), what happens depends
*     on the setting of Adaptive. If Adaptive is non-zero, the Mapping
*     from the old to the new coordinate system is found. In this case it
*     is a simple scaling by a factor of 0.1 (since 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm).
*     This Mapping is then used to modify the numerical values within the
*     Region, changing 2000 to 200 and 4000 to 400. Thus the modified
*     region represents 200 nm to 400 nm, the same physical space as
*     the original 2000 Angstrom to 4000 Angstrom. However, if Adaptive
*     had been zero, then the numerical values would not have been changed,
*     resulting in the final Region representing 2000 nm to 4000 nm.
*
*     Setting Adaptive to zero can be necessary if you need to correct
*     inaccurate attribute settings in an existing Region. For instance,
*     when creating a Region you may not know what Epoch value to use, so
*     you would leave Epoch unset resulting in some default value being used.
*     If at some later point in the application, the correct Epoch value
*     is determined, you could assign the correct value to the Epoch
*     attribute. However, you would first need to set Adaptive temporarily
*     to zero, because otherwise the area represented by the Region would
*     be Mapped from the spurious default Epoch to the new correct Epoch,
*     which is not what is required.

*  Applicability:
*     Region
*        All Regions have this attribute.

*     Note, whether the boundary is considered to be inside the Region or
*     not is controlled by the Closed attribute. Changing the value of

*     Thus, if Region is closed, then the boundary of the Region will be

*  Name:
*     RegionFS

*  Purpose:
*     Should Region FrameSet be dumped?

*  Type:
*     Protected attribute.

*  Synopsis:
*     Integer (boolean).

*  Description:
*     This attribute indicates whether the FrameSet encapsulated by the
*     Region should be included in the dump produced by the Dump function.
*
*     If set to a non-zero value (the default), the FrameSet in the Region
*     will always be included in the dump as usual. If set to zero, the
*     FrameSet will only be included in the dump if the Mapping from base
*     to current Frame is not a UnitMap. If the base->current Mapping is
*     a UnitMap, the FrameSet is omitted from the dump. If the dump is
*     subsequently used to re-create the Region, the new Region will have a
*     default FrameSet containing a single default Frame with the appropriate
*     number of axes.
*
*     This facility is indended to reduce the size of textual dumps of
*     Regions in situations where the Frame to which the Region refers can
*     be implied by the context in which the Region is used. This is
*     often the case when a Region is encapsulated within another Region.
*     In such cases the current Frame of the encapsulated Region will
*     usually be equivalent to the base Frame of the parent Region
*     structure, and so can be re-instated (by calling the astSetRegFS
*     method) even if the FrameSet is omitted from the dump of the
*     encapsulated Region. Note if the base->current Mapping in the FrameSet
*     in the encapsulated Region is not a UnitMap, then we should always
*     dump the FrameSet regardless of the setting of RegionFS. This is because
*     the parent Region structure will not know how to convert the PointSet
*     stored in the encapsulated Region into its own base Frame if the
*     FrameSet is not available.

*  Description:
*     This attribute controls how many points are used when creating a

*     mesh is returned by the
c     astGetRegionMesh
f     AST_GETREGIONMESH

*     between two Regions: each point in the bomdary mesh of the first
*     Region is checked to see if it is inside or outside the second Region.
*     Thus, the reliability of the overlap check depends on the value assigned
*     to this attribute. If the value used is very low, it is possible for
*     overlaps to go unnoticed. High values produce more reliable results, but
*     can result in the overlap test being very slow. The default value is 200

*  Class Membership:
*     Region initialiser.

*  Description:
*     This function is provided for use by class implementations to
*     initialise a new Region object. It allocates memory (if
*     necessary) to accommodate the Region plus any additional data
*     associated with the derived class.  It then initialises a
*     Region structure at the start of this memory. If the "init"
*     flag is set, it also initialises the contents of a virtual
*     function table for a Region at the start of the memory passed
*     via the "vtab" parameter.

*  Parameters:
*     mem
*        A pointer to the memory in which the Region is to be
*        created. This must be of sufficient size to accommodate the
*        Region data (sizeof(Region)) plus any data used by the
*        derived class. If a value of NULL is given, this function
*        will allocate the memory itself using the "size" parameter to
*        determine its size.
*     size
*        The amount of memory used by the Region (plus derived class
*        data).  This will be used to allocate memory if a value of
*        NULL is given for the "mem" parameter. This value is also
*        stored in the Region structure, so a valid value must be
*        supplied even if not required for allocating memory.
*     init
*        A logical flag indicating if the Region's virtual function
*        table is to be initialised. If this value is non-zero, the
*        virtual function table will be initialised by this function.
*     vtab
*        Pointer to the start of the virtual function table to be
*        associated with the new Region.
*     name
*        Pointer to a constant null-terminated character string which
*        contains the name of the class to which the new object
*        belongs (it is this pointer value that will subsequently be
*        returned by the astGetClass method).
*     frame
*        Pointer to the encapsulated Frame. A deep copy of this Frame is
*        taken. This means that subsequent changes to the supplied Frame
*        will have no effect on the new Region.
*     pset
*        A PointSet holding the points which define the Region. These
*        positions should refer to the given Frame. May be NULL.
*     unc
*        A pointer to a Region which specifies the uncertainty in the
*        supplied positions (all points on the boundary of the new Region
*        being initialised are assumed to have the same uncertainty). A NULL
*        pointer can be supplied, in which case default uncertainties equal to
*        1.0E-6 of the dimensions of the new Region's bounding box are used.
*        If an uncertainty Region is supplied, it must be of a class for
*        which all instances are centro-symetric (e.g. Box, Circle, Ellipse,
*        etc.) or be a Prism containing centro-symetric component Regions.
*        Its encapsulated Frame must be related to the Frame supplied for
*        parameter "frame" (i.e. astConvert should be able to find a Mapping
*        between them). Two positions in the "frame" Frame are considered to be
*        co-incident if their uncertainty Regions overlap. The centre of the
*        supplied uncertainty Region is immaterial since it will be re-centred
*        on the point being tested before use. A deep copy is taken of the
*        supplied Region.

*  Returned Value:
*     A pointer to the new Region.

*  Notes:
*     - A null pointer will be returned if this function is invoked
*     with the global error status set, or if it should fail for any
*     reason.

*
*        If the "vtab" parameter is NULL, the "size" value is ignored

*++
*  Name:
c     astMapRegion
f     AST_MAPREGION

*  Purpose:
*     Transform a Region into a new Frame using a given Mapping.

*  Type:
*     Public virtual function.

*  Synopsis:
c     #include "region.h"
c     AstRegion *astMapRegion( AstRegion *this, AstMapping *map,
c                              AstFrame *frame )
f     RESULT = AST_MAPREGION( THIS, MAP, FRAME, STATUS )

*  Class Membership:
*     Region method.

*  Description:
*     This function returns a pointer to a new Region which corresponds to
*     supplied Region described by some other specified coordinate system. A
*     Mapping is supplied which transforms positions between the old and new
*     coordinate systems. The new Region may not be of the same class as
*     the original region.

*  Parameters:
c     this
f     THIS = INTEGER (Given)
*        Pointer to the Region.
c     map
f     MAP = INTEGER (Given)
*        Pointer to a Mapping which transforms positions from the
*        coordinate system represented by the supplied Region to the
*        coordinate system specified by
c        "frame".
f        FRAME.
*        The supplied Mapping should define both forward and inverse
*        transformations, and these transformations should form a genuine
*        inverse pair. That is, transforming a position using the forward
*        transformation and then using the inverse transformation should
*        produce the original input position. Some Mapping classes (such
*        as PermMap, MathMap, SphMap) can result in Mappings for which this
*        is not true.
c     frame
f     FRAME = INTEGER (Given)
*        Pointer to a Frame describing the coordinate system in which
*        the new Region is required.
f     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
f        The global status.

*  Returned Value:
c     astMapRegion()
f     AST_MAPREGION = INTEGER
*        A pointer to a new Region. This Region will represent the area
*        within the coordinate system specified by
c        "frame"
f        FRAME
*        which corresponds to the supplied Region.

*  Notes:
*     - The uncertainty associated with the supplied Region is modified
*     using the supplied Mapping.
*     - A null Object pointer (AST__NULL) will be returned if this
c     function is invoked with the AST error status set, or if it
f     function is invoked with STATUS set to an error value, or if it
*     should fail for any reason.
*--

*  Implementation Notes:
*     - The only difference between this public interface and the protected
*     astMapRegion interface is that this implementation additionally
*     simplifies the returned Region. The protected implementation does
*     not do this since doing so can lead to infinite recursion because
*     it is sometimes necessary for Simplify to call astMapRegion.
