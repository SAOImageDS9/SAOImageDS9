[description]
[para]

The application described by this document, [syscmd diagram-viewer], is a
lightweight processor for tklib diagram files

[para]

[syscmd diagram-viewer] is based upon the package [package diagram].
See it for examples and language reference.

[subsection {USE CASES}]

[syscmd diagram-viewer] was written with the following two use cases in
mind.

[para]
[list_begin enumerated]
[enum]
Processing and display of one or more diagram files.

[enum]
Batch conversion of one or more diagram files into raster image files.

[list_end]

[para]

[subsection {COMMAND LINE}]

[list_begin definitions]

[call [cmd diagram-viewer] [method show] [arg inputfile]...]

This is the form for use case [lb]1[rb]. The application opens a gui
showing the list of input files to the left, allowing the user to
choose which of them to render to the canvas on the right.

[call [cmd diagram-viewer] [method convert] [option -o] [arg output] [arg format] [arg inputfile]...]

This is the form for use case [lb]2[rb]. The application converts
the input files into raster image of the specified [arg format].

[list_begin arguments]

[arg_def path output in]

This argument specifies where to write the generated image. It can
be the path to a file or directory.

[para]

If the [arg output] does not exist then [lb]file dirname $output[rb]
has to exist and must be a writable directory.

[para]
In case of multiple input files the generated image will be written to
a file in the directory, and the name of that file will be derived
from the [arg inputfile], and [arg format].

[para]
In case of a single input file the generated image will be written to
the file.

[arg_def (handle) format in]

This argument specifies the image format to convert the diagrams into
when processing the input. The application recognizes all formats
supported by the [package Img] package, i.e. for which it can load a
package [package img::[var format]]

[arg_def path inputfile in]

This argument specifies the path to the diagram file to process. It
has to exist, must be readable, and written in [term diagram] format.

[list_end]
[para]

[list_end]
