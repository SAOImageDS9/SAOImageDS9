:warning: 
This repository is mirrored to [github](https://github.com/tcltk/tcllib).

We are __not tracking issues at github__.  With the exeception of the
maintainer of the mirroring setup nobody will even see issues created
at github.

instead.

# Welcome

Welcome to Tcllib, the Tcl Standard Library. Note that Tcllib is not a
package itself. It is a collection of (semi-independent) Tcl packages
that provide utility functions useful to a large collection of Tcl
programmers.

At our [home site](http://core.tcl-lang.org/tcllib) you will find the
official fossil repository used to manage our sources, together with
the bug tracker. This is also the main location for releases to
download from.

We have a
[secondary download location](https://sourceforge.net/projects/tcllib/files)
where the Tcllib sources were hosted in the past. SourceForge is also
where our [mailing lists](https://sourceforge.net/p/tcllib/mailman)
are (still) hosted.

Another location to find these sources at is the
[github mirror](https://github.com/tcltk/tcllib).

Please note the :warning: at the top.
