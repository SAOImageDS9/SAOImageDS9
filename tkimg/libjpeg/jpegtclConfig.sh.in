# jpegtclConfig.sh --
#
# This shell script (for sh) is generated automatically by jpegtcl's
# configure script.  It will create shell variables for most of
# the configuration options discovered by the configure script.
# This script is intended to be included by the configure scripts
# for jpegtcl extensions so that they don't have to figure this all
# out for themselves.  This file does not duplicate information
# already provided by tclConfig.sh, so you may need to use that
# file in addition to this one.

# The information in this file is specific to a single platform.
