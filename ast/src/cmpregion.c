/*
*class++
*  Name:
*     CmpRegion

*  Purpose:
*     A combination of two regions within a single Frame

*  Constructor Function:
c     astCmpRegion
f     AST_CMPREGION

*  Description:
*     A CmpRegion is a Region which allows two component
*     Regions (of any class) to be combined to form a more complex
*     Region. This combination may be performed a boolean AND, OR
*     or XOR (exclusive OR) operator. If the AND operator is
*     used, then a position is inside the CmpRegion only if it is
*     inside both of its two component Regions. If the OR operator is
*     used, then a position is inside the CmpRegion if it is inside
*     either (or both) of its two component Regions. If the XOR operator
*     is used, then a position is inside the CmpRegion if it is inside
*     one but not both of its two component Regions. Other operators can
*     be formed by negating one or both component Regions before using
*     them to construct a new CmpRegion.
*
*     The two component Region need not refer to the same coordinate
*     Frame, but it must be possible for the
c     astConvert
f     AST_CONVERT
*     function to determine a Mapping between them (an error will be
*     reported otherwise when the CmpRegion is created). For instance,
*     a CmpRegion may combine a Region defined within an ICRS SkyFrame
*     with a Region defined within a Galactic SkyFrame. This is
*     acceptable because the SkyFrame class knows how to convert between
*     these two systems, and consequently the
c     astConvert
f     AST_CONVERT
*     function will also be able to convert between them. In such cases,
*     the second component Region will be mapped into the coordinate Frame
*     of the first component Region, and the Frame represented by the
*     CmpRegion as a whole will be the Frame of the first component Region.
*
*     Since a CmpRegion is itself a Region, it can be used as a
*     component in forming further CmpRegions. Regions of arbitrary
*     complexity may be built from simple individual Regions in this
*     way.

*  Inheritance:
*     The CmpRegion class inherits from the Region class.

*  Attributes:
*     The CmpRegion class does not define any new attributes beyond those
*     which are applicable to all Regions.

*  Functions:
c     The CmpRegion class does not define any new functions beyond those
f     The CmpRegion class does not define any new routines beyond those
*     which are applicable to all Regions.

*  History:
*     7-OCT-2004 (DSB):
*        Original version.
*     28-MAY-2007 (DSB):
*        - Corrected RegBaseMesh.
*        - In RegBaseBox, if the CmpRegion is bounded find the box by
*        finding the extreme position sin a mesh covering the boundary.
*     20-JAN-2009 (DSB):
*        Over-ride astRegBasePick.
*     19-MAR-2009 (DSB):
*        Over-ride the astDecompose method.
*     8-SEP-2009 (DSB):
*        Fix logic in RegTrace.
*     9-SEP-2009 (DSB):
*        - Added astCmpRegionList
*        - Added support for XOR
*        - Override astGetObjSize.
*     27-APR-2012 (DSB):
*        - Cache the bounded property.
*        - Speed up plotting of CmpRegions by using the cached negation
*        of a Region instead of setting the Regions's Negated flag (which
*        causes the Region's cache to be cleared).
*     30-APR-2012 (DSB):
*        Use geodesic distance to measure distances around the two component
*        Regions when tracing the border. Previously, a distance normalised
*        from zero to one was used for both component Regions, but this gives
*        greater priority to Regions higher in the CmpRegion nesting order,
*        resulting in a high chance that lower Regions will not be seen.
*     7-JUN-2012 (DSB):
*        Override astRegSplit method.
*     21-NOV-2012 (DSB):
*        Map the regions returned by RegSplit into the current Frame of the
*        CmpRegion.

*  Name:
*     astCmpRegionList

*  Purpose:
*     Decompose a CmpRegion into a sequence of simpler Regions.

*  Type:
*     Protected virtual function.

*  Synopsis:
*     #include "cmpregion.h"
*     int astCmpRegionList( AstCmpRegion *this, int *nreg,

*  Class Membership:
*     CmpRegion method.

*  Description:
*     This function decomposes a CmpRegion into a sequence of simpler
*     Regions which may be applied in sequence to achieve the same
*     effect.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the CmpRegion to be decomposed (the CmpRegion is not
*        actually modified by this function).
*     nreg
*        The address of an int which holds a count of the number of
*        individual Regions in the decomposition. On entry, this
*        should count the number of Regions already in the
*        "*reg_list" array (below). On exit, it is updated to include
*        any new Regions appended by this function.
*     reg_list
*        Address of a pointer to an array of Region pointers. On
*        entry, this array pointer should either be NULL (if no
*        Regions have yet been obtained) or should point at a
*        dynamically allocated array containing Region pointers
*        ("*nreg" in number) which have been obtained from a previous
*        invocation of this function.
*
*        On exit, the dynamic array will be enlarged to contain any
*        new Region pointers that result from the decomposition
*        requested. These pointers will be appended to any previously
*        present, and the array pointer will be updated as necessary
*        to refer to the enlarged array (any space released by the
*        original array will be freed automatically).
*
*        The new Region pointers returned will identify a sequence of
*        Region which, when applied in order, will represent an area
*        equivalent to that of the original Region.
*
*        All the Region pointers returned by this function should be
*        annulled by the caller, using astAnnul, when no longer
*        required. The dynamic array holding these pointers should
*        also be freed, using astFree.

*  Returned Value:
*     An integer identifying the boolean operation that should be used to
*     combine the Regions returned in "reg_list". This will be AST__AND
*     or AST__OR.

*
*     Since the Frame class inherits from the Mapping class, Frames can
*     be considered as special types of Mappings and so this method can
*     be used to decompose either CmpMaps, CmpFrames, CmpRegions or Prisms.

*     map1

*        Mapping.
*     map2
*        Address of a location to receive a pointer to second component
*        Mapping.
*     series
*        Address of a location to receive a value indicating if the
*        component Mappings are applied in series or parallel. A non-zero
*        value means that the supplied Mapping is equivalent to applying map1
*        followed by map2 in series. A zero value means that the supplied
*        Mapping is equivalent to applying map1 to the lower numbered axes
*        and map2 to the higher numbered axes, in parallel.
*     invert1
*        The value of the Invert attribute to be used with map1.
*     invert2
*        The value of the Invert attribute to be used with map2.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Notes:
*     - Any changes made to the component rames using the returned
*     pointers will be reflected in the supplied CmpFrame.

*  Synopsis:
*     #include "region.h"
*     AstRegion **astRegSplit( AstRegion *this, int *nlist )

*  Class Membership:

*  Description:
*     This function splits the supplied Region into a set of disjoint
*     component Regions. If the Region cannot be split, then the returned
*     array contains only one pointer - a clone of the supplied Region
*     pointer.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the Region.
*     nlist
*        Pointer to an int in which to return the number of elements in
*        the returned array.

*  Returned Value:
*     Pointer to dynamically alloctaed memory holding an array of Region
*     pointers. The length of this array is given by the value returned
*     in "*nlist". The pointers in the returned array should be annulled
*     using astAnnul when no longer needed, and the memory used to hold
*     the array should be freed using astFree.

*  Notes:
*    - A NULL pointer is returned if an error has already occurred, or if
*    this function should fail for any reason.

*  Synopsis:
*     #include "cmpregion.h"

*  Class Membership:
*     CmpRegion member function (overrides the astRegTrace method
*     inherited from the parent Region class).

*  Description:
*     This function returns positions on the boundary of the supplied
*     Region, if possible. The required positions are indicated by a
*     supplied list of scalar parameter values in the range zero to one.
*     Zero corresponds to some arbitrary starting point on the boundary,
*     and one corresponds to the end (which for a closed region will be
*     the same place as the start).

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the Region.
*     n
*        The number of positions to return. If this is zero, the function
*        returns without action (but the returned function value still
*        indicates if the method is supported or not).
*     dist
*        Pointer to an array of "n" scalar parameter values in the range
*        0 to 1.0.
*     ptr
*        A pointer to an array of pointers. The number of elements in
*        this array should equal tthe number of axes in the Frame spanned
*        by the Region. Each element of the array should be a pointer to
*        an array of "n" doubles, in which to return the "n" values for
*        the corresponding axis. The contents of the arrays are unchanged
*        if the supplied Region belongs to a class that does not
*        implement this method.

*  Returned Value:
*     Non-zero if the astRegTrace method is implemented by the class
*     of Region supplied, and zero if not.

*  Notes:
*    - The current algorithm results in the boundary of the CmpRegion
*    being dis-contiguous - supplied distance values from zero up to some
*    mid-value correspond to positions on the first component Region, and
*    higher distance (up to 1.0) correspond to points on the second
*    component Region.

*  Synopsis:
*     #include "cmpregion.h"
*     void SetBreakInfo( AstCmpRegion *this, int comp, int *status )

*  Class Membership:
*     CmpRegion method.

*  Description:
*     This function returns without action if the supplied CmpRegion
*     already contains break information for the specified component Region.
*     Otherwise, it creates the required information and stores it in the
*     CmpRegion.
*
*     Each component Region in the CmpRegion has a boundary. But in
*     general only part of the boundary of a component Region will also
*     be included in the CmpRegion boundary. Thus the component Region
*     boundary can be broken up into sections; sections that form part
*     of the CmpRegion boundary, and sections that do not. This function
*     stores information about the breaks between these sections.
*
*     The complete boundary of a component Region is parameterised by a
*     geodesic distance that goes from 0.0 to the value found by this
*     function and stored in this->dtot (the total geodesic distance
*     around the border). This function find the ranges of this parameter
*     that correspond to the sections of the boundary that are also on the
*     CmpRegion boundary, and thus finds the total length that the component
*     boundary contributes to the CmpRegion boundary. This length is stored
*     in "this->d0" (a two element array, one for each component Region).
*
*     It also find two arrays "this->rvals" and "this->offs" that allow a
*     distance value in the range 0.0 to "this->d0" (i.e. a distance
*     measured by skipping over the parts of the component boundary that
*     are not on the CmpRegion boundary), to be converted into the
*     corresponding distance value in the range 0.0 to "this->dtot" (i.e. a
*     distance measured round the complete component boundary, including the
*     parts not on the CmpRegion boundary).

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to a CmpRegion.
*     comp
*        Zero or one, indicating which component Region is to be checked.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Name:
*     Transform

*  Purpose:
*     Apply a CmpRegion to transform a set of points.

*  Type:
*     Private function.

*  Synopsis:
*     #include "cmpregion.h"
*     AstPointSet *Transform( AstMapping *this, AstPointSet *in,
*                             int forward, AstPointSet *out, int *status )

*  Class Membership:
*     CmpRegion member function (over-rides the astTransform method inherited
*     from the Region class).

*  Description:
*     This function takes a CmpRegion and a set of points encapsulated in a
*     PointSet and transforms the points so as to apply the required Region.
*     This implies applying each of the CmpRegion's component Regions in turn,
*     either in series or in parallel.

*  Parameters:
*     this
*        Pointer to the CmpRegion.
*     in
*        Pointer to the PointSet associated with the input coordinate values.
*     forward
*        A non-zero value indicates that the forward coordinate transformation
*        should be applied, while a zero value requests the inverse
*        transformation.
*     out
*        Pointer to a PointSet which will hold the transformed (output)
*        coordinate values. A NULL value may also be given, in which case a
*        new PointSet will be created by this function.
*     status
*        Pointer to the inherited status variable.

*  Returned Value:
*     Pointer to the output (possibly new) PointSet.

*  Notes:
*     -  A null pointer will be returned if this function is invoked with the
*     global error status set, or if it should fail for any reason.
*     -  The number of coordinate values per point in the input PointSet must
*     match the number of coordinates for the CmpRegion being applied.
*     -  If an output PointSet is supplied, it must have space for sufficient
*     number of points and coordinate values per point to accommodate the
*     result. Any excess space will be ignored.

f     RESULT = AST_CMPREGION( REGION1, REGION2, OPER, OPTIONS, STATUS )

*  Class Membership:
*     CmpRegion constructor.

*  Description:
*     This function creates a new CmpRegion and optionally initialises
*     its attributes.
*
*     A CmpRegion is a Region which allows two component
*     Regions (of any class) to be combined to form a more complex
*     Region. This combination may be performed a boolean AND, OR
*     or XOR (exclusive OR) operator. If the AND operator is
*     used, then a position is inside the CmpRegion only if it is
*     inside both of its two component Regions. If the OR operator is
*     used, then a position is inside the CmpRegion if it is inside
*     either (or both) of its two component Regions. If the XOR operator
*     is used, then a position is inside the CmpRegion if it is inside
*     one but not both of its two component Regions. Other operators can
*     be formed by negating one or both component Regions before using
*     them to construct a new CmpRegion.
*
*     The two component Region need not refer to the same coordinate
*     Frame, but it must be possible for the
c     astConvert
f     AST_CONVERT
*     function to determine a Mapping between them (an error will be
*     reported otherwise when the CmpRegion is created). For instance,
*     a CmpRegion may combine a Region defined within an ICRS SkyFrame
*     with a Region defined within a Galactic SkyFrame. This is
*     acceptable because the SkyFrame class knows how to convert between
*     these two systems, and consequently the
c     astConvert
f     AST_CONVERT
*     function will also be able to convert between them. In such cases,
*     the second component Region will be mapped into the coordinate Frame
*     of the first component Region, and the Frame represented by the
*     CmpRegion as a whole will be the Frame of the first component Region.
*
*     Since a CmpRegion is itself a Region, it can be used as a
*     component in forming further CmpRegions. Regions of arbitrary
*     complexity may be built from simple individual Regions in this
*     way.

*  Parameters:
c     region1
f     REGION1 = INTEGER (Given)
*        Pointer to the first component Region.
c     region2
f     REGION2 = INTEGER (Given)
*        Pointer to the second component Region. This Region will be
*        transformed into the coordinate Frame of the first region before
*        use. An error will be reported if this is not possible.
c     oper
f     OPER = INTEGER (Given)
*        The boolean operator with which to combine the two Regions. This
*        must be one of the symbolic constants AST__AND, AST__OR or AST__XOR.
c     options
f     OPTIONS = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
c        Pointer to a null-terminated string containing an optional
c        comma-separated list of attribute assignments to be used for
c        initialising the new CmpRegion. The syntax used is identical to
c        that for the astSet function and may include "printf" format
c        specifiers identified by "%" symbols in the normal way.
f        A character string containing an optional comma-separated
f        list of attribute assignments to be used for initialising the
f        new CmpRegion. The syntax used is identical to that for the
f        AST_SET routine.
c     ...
c        If the "options" string contains "%" format specifiers, then
c        an optional list of additional arguments may follow it in
c        order to supply values to be substituted for these
c        specifiers. The rules for supplying these are identical to
c        those for the astSet function (and for the C "printf"
c        function).
f     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
f        The global status.

*  Returned Value:
c     astCmpRegion()
f     AST_CMPREGION = INTEGER
*        A pointer to the new CmpRegion.

*  Notes:
*     - If one of the supplied Regions has an associated uncertainty,
*     that uncertainty will also be used for the returned CmpRegion.
*     If both supplied Regions have associated uncertainties, the
*     uncertainty associated with the first Region will be used for the
*     returned CmpRegion.
*     - Deep copies are taken of the supplied Regions. This means that
*     any subsequent changes made to the component Regions using the
*     supplied pointers will have no effect on the CmpRegion.
*     - A null Object pointer (AST__NULL) will be returned if this
c     function is invoked with the AST error status set, or if it
f     function is invoked with STATUS set to an error value, or if it
*     should fail for any reason.
*--

*  Implementation Notes:
*     - This function implements the external (public) interface to
*     the astCmpRegion constructor function. It returns an ID value
*     (instead of a true C pointer) to external users, and must be
*     provided because astCmpRegion_ has a variable argument list which
*     cannot be encapsulated in a macro (where this conversion would
*     otherwise occur).
*     - Because no checking or casting of arguments is performed
*     before the function is invoked, the "region1" and "region2" parameters
*     are of type (void *) and are converted from an ID value to a
*     pointer and validated within the function itself.
*     - The variable argument list also prevents this function from
*     invoking astCmpRegion_ directly, so it must be a re-implementation
*     of it in all respects, except for the conversions between IDs
*     and pointers on input/output of Objects.

*  Description:
*     This function is provided for use by class implementations to initialise
*     a new CmpRegion object. It allocates memory (if necessary) to
*     accommodate the CmpRegion plus any additional data associated with the

*     of this memory. If the "init" flag is set, it also initialises the
*     contents of a virtual function table for a CmpRegion at the start of
*     the memory passed via the "vtab" parameter.

*  Parameters:
*     mem
*        A pointer to the memory in which the CmpRegion is to be initialised.
*        This must be of sufficient size to accommodate the CmpRegion data
*        (sizeof(CmpRegion)) plus any data used by the derived class. If a
*        value of NULL is given, this function will allocate the memory itself
*        using the "size" parameter to determine its size.
*     size
*        The amount of memory used by the CmpRegion (plus derived class
*        data). This will be used to allocate memory if a value of NULL is
*        given for the "mem" parameter. This value is also stored in the
*        CmpRegion structure, so a valid value must be supplied even if not
*        required for allocating memory.
*     init
*        A logical flag indicating if the CmpRegion's virtual function table
*        is to be initialised. If this value is non-zero, the virtual function
*        table will be initialised by this function.
*     vtab
*        Pointer to the start of the virtual function table to be associated
*        with the new CmpRegion.
*     name
*        Pointer to a constant null-terminated character string which contains
*        the name of the class to which the new object belongs (it is this
*        pointer value that will subsequently be returned by the Object
*        astClass function).
*     region1
*        Pointer to the first Region.
*     region2
*        Pointer to the second Region.
*     oper
*        The boolean operator to use. Must be one of AST__AND, AST__OR or
*        AST__XOR.

*  Returned Value:
*     A pointer to the new CmpRegion.

*  Notes:
*     -  A null pointer will be returned if this function is invoked with the

*+
*  Name:
*     astLoadCmpRegion

*  Purpose:
*     Load a CmpRegion.

*  Type:
*     Protected function.

*  Synopsis:
*     #include "cmpregion.h"
*     AstCmpRegion *astLoadCmpRegion( void *mem, size_t size,
*                                     AstCmpRegionVtab *vtab, const char *name,
*                                     AstChannel *channel )

*  Class Membership:
*     CmpRegion loader.

*  Description:
*     This function is provided to load a new CmpRegion using data read
*     from a Channel. It first loads the data used by the parent class
*     (which allocates memory if necessary) and then initialises a
*     CmpRegion structure in this memory, using data read from the input
*     Channel.
*
*     If the "init" flag is set, it also initialises the contents of a
*     virtual function table for a CmpRegion at the start of the memory
*     passed via the "vtab" parameter.


*  Parameters:
*     mem
*        A pointer to the memory into which the CmpRegion is to be
*        loaded.  This must be of sufficient size to accommodate the
*        CmpRegion data (sizeof(CmpRegion)) plus any data used by derived
*        classes. If a value of NULL is given, this function will
*        allocate the memory itself using the "size" parameter to
*        determine its size.
*     size
*        The amount of memory used by the CmpRegion (plus derived class
*        data).  This will be used to allocate memory if a value of
*        NULL is given for the "mem" parameter. This value is also
*        stored in the CmpRegion structure, so a valid value must be
*        supplied even if not required for allocating memory.
*
*        If the "vtab" parameter is NULL, the "size" value is ignored
*        and sizeof(AstCmpRegion) is used instead.
*     vtab
*        Pointer to the start of the virtual function table to be
*        associated with the new CmpRegion. If this is NULL, a pointer to
*        the (static) virtual function table for the CmpRegion class is
*        used instead.
*     name
*        Pointer to a constant null-terminated character string which
*        contains the name of the class to which the new object
*        belongs (it is this pointer value that will subsequently be
*        returned by the astGetClass method).
*
*        If the "vtab" parameter is NULL, the "name" value is ignored
*        and a pointer to the string "CmpRegion" is used instead.

*  Returned Value:
*     A pointer to the new CmpRegion.

*  Notes:
*     - A null pointer will be returned if this function is invoked
*     with the global error status set, or if it should fail for any
*     reason.
