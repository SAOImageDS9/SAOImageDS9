<p>Allows the user to customize the appearance and behavior of the GUI . Please note: some preferences take effect immediately, while others require DS9 to be restarted. Changes to the preferences can be saved by selecting the <tt>Save</tt> button<tt>.</tt> Use the <tt>Clear Preferences</tt> button to restore default settings.</p>
<p>User preferences are stored in <tt>$HOME/.ds9.prf</tt>. DO NOT EDIT this file, since it will be deleted or overwritten by DS9. The file permissions must be group/world readonly.<br></p>
<p>Users may have several different preference files. DS9 looks for a preference file with its own name. By default, if the application is named <tt>ds9</tt>, it will look for <tt>.ds9.prf.</tt> However, if the DS9 application is named <tt>foo</tt>, then DS9 will look for <tt>.foo.prf.</tt> In this manner, the user can have several predefined preference files that are activated by invoking DS9 with a different application names.</p>
