	Kevin's Hacky Input Method (KHIM)

	KHIM allows you to input international characters from a
	keyboard that doesn't support them.  It works independently of
	any input method that the operating system may supply; it is
	intended for when you don't have control over your keyboard
	mapping and still need to input text in other languages.

	To use KHIM, bring up the KHIM Controls (the way this is done
        depends on your application) and enable KHIM by checking "Use
        KHIM".  You also need to choose a key on your keyboard that is
        seldom used, and designate it as the "Compose" key by pressing
        the button labelled, "Compose key:" then striking the key you
        wish to designate.  Generally speaking, this key should not be
        the key designated as "Compose" on the keyboard; that key will
        continue to invoke whatever input method the local operating
        system supplies.

	Once KHIM is enabled, you can enter international characters
	in any widget that is configured to use KHIM by pressing the
	Compose key followed by a two-character sequence.  The listbox
	in the KHIM controls shows the available sequences.  In
	addition, if you strike the Compose key twice, you get a
	dialog that allows you to input arbitrary symbols from a
	Unicode character map. In the map, you can navigate among the
	characters using either the cursor keys or the mouse, and you
	can select the current character for insertion by
	double-clicking it, pressing the space bar, or pressing the
	Enter (or Return) key.

	To define a new sequence for use with the Compose key, bring
	up the KHIM controls, enter the two characters in the
	"Input key sequence" entry and the desired character to insert
	into the "Character" entry, and press "Change".  (You may copy
	and paste the character from another application, or use the
	"Unicode..." button (or press the Compose key twice) to select
	the character from a map of all available Unicode code
	points.) To remove a sequence, select it in the listbox and
	press "Delete".

    }

    ::msgcat::mcset {} {SELECT COMPOSE KEY} [string map [list \n\t \n] {
	Please press the 
	key that you want 
	to use as the 
	"Compose" key.
    }]
