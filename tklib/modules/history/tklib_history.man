The history may be accessed with the up and down arrow keys.

[call [cmd ::history::init] [arg pathName] [opt length]]

Arranges to remember the history of the named Entry widget. An optional length
determines the number of history entries to keep. This may be changed later
with [cmd ::history::configure]. History entries must be added with the
[cmd ::history::add] command before they can be seen.

[call [cmd ::history::remove] [arg pathName]]

Forgets all history entries for the Entry [arg pathName] and removes the history
bindings.

[call [cmd ::history::add] [arg pathName] [arg text]]

This command is used to add history entries to an Entry that has previously had
[cmd ::history::init] called on it. This command should be called from your Entry
handler with the contents of the entry (or whatever you wish to add to the history).

[call [cmd ::history::get] [arg pathName]]

This command returns a list containing the history entries for the Entry [arg pathName]

[call [cmd ::history::clear] [arg pathName]]

This command clears the history list for the named Entry.

[call [cmd ::history::configure] [arg pathName] [arg option] [opt value]]

This command queries or sets configuration options. Currently the options recognized
are [arg length] and [arg alert]. Setting the length determines the number of history entries to keep for
the named Entry. Alert specifies the command to run when the user reaches the end of the history, it defaults to [call bell]. Although configure requires a [arg pathName] argument, the setting for alert is global and the path is ignored.
