/* Name:
      stcschan-demo3.c

   Purpose:
      A demonstration of the facilities provided by the AST library
      for reading STC metadata encoded using the STC-S linear string
      format.

   Description:
      This program reads an STC-S description from a text file, and also
      reads a set of 2-D spatial FITS-WCS headers from another (text) file.
      It then opens a specified graphics device, and displays an annotated
      coordinate grid covering the region described by the FITS headers.
      Finally, it draws the outline of the spatial extent of the STC-S
      description over the top of the annotated coordinate grid.

   Usage:
      % stcschan-demo3 <stcs-file> <header-file> <device>

      <stcs-file>: The path to a text file containing the STC-S
      description.

      <header-file>: The path to a text file containing a set of FITS-WCS
      headers.

      <device>: The name of an available PGPLOT graphics device. If not
      supplied, the available device names will be listed and the program
      will then exit.

   Example:
      % stcschan-demo3 m31.stcs andromeda.head /xserve

   To compile and link:
      Assuming your starlink distribution is in "/star":

      % gcc -o stcschan-demo3 stcschan-demo3.c -g -L/star/lib \
             -I/star/include `ast_link -pgplot` -lcpgplot
