Tkpiechart is a Tcl only library which allows the creation of 2D or 3D
pies with labels in Tcl canvases.
This is version 6.6. It was tested with Tcl/Tk 8.3 and 8.4 on both
Linux and Windows platforms (it should work on all Tcl/Tk supported
platforms).
It is object oriented using the stooop (Simple Tcl Only Object
Oriented Programming) extension (version 4.1 or above).
A demo.tcl demonstration script is included.
