[description]

The [package crosshair] package provides commands to (de)activate and
track crosshairs on canvas widgets.

[section API]

The following commands are exported to the public:

[list_begin definitions]

[call [cmd crosshair::crosshair] [arg w] [opt [arg arg]...]]

This command activates the display of a pair of cross-hairs for the
canvas widget [arg w]. The cross-hairs track the pointing device. The
result of the command is the empty string.

[para]

All arguments after the widget [arg w] are treated as options as for a
canvas line item in [arg w]. Of particular interest are [option -fill]
and [option -dash].

[call [cmd crosshair::off] [arg w]]

This command removes the cross-hairs from the canvas widget [arg w].
Nothing is done if the widget had no cross-hairs. The result of the
command is the empty string.

[call [cmd crosshair::configure] [arg w] [opt [arg arg]...]]

This command changes the appearance of the cross-hairs in the canvas
widget [arg w]. It is an error to call it for a canvas which has no
cross-hairs.

[para]

All arguments after the widget [arg w] are treated as options as for a
canvas line item in [arg w]. Of particular interest are [option -fill]
and [option -dash].

[para]

The result of the command are the current configuration settings.

[call [cmd crosshair::track] [method on] [arg w] [arg cmdprefix]]

This command activates reporting of the location of the cross-hairs in
the canvas widget [arg w]. It is an error to use this command for a
canvas which has no cross-hairs. The result of the command is the
empty string.

[para]

After the invokation of this command the specified command prefix
[arg cmdprefix] will be called whenever the mouse moves within the
canvas, with 7 arguments. These are, in order:

[list_begin enum]
[enum] The widget [arg w]
[enum] The x-location of the cross-hairs, in pixels.
[enum] The y-location of the cross-hairs, in pixels.
[enum] The x-location of the top-left corner of the viewport, in pixels.
[enum] The y-location of the top-left corner of the viewport, in pixels.
[enum] The x-location of the bottom-right corner of the viewport, in pixels.
[enum] The y-location of the bottom-right corner of the viewport, in pixels.
[list_end]

A previously existing callback for [arg w] will be disabled. I.e. per
canvas widget with cross-hairs only one callback reporting their
location is possible.

[call [cmd crosshair::track] [method off] [arg w]]

This command disables the reporting of the location of the cross-hairs
in the canvas widget [arg w]. It is an error to use this command for a
canvas which has no cross-hairs. The result of the command is the
empty string.

[call [cmd crosshair::bbox_add] [arg w] [arg bbox]]

This command adds a bounding box to the crosshairs for canvas [arg w].
The crosshairs will only be active within that area.

[para] The result of the command is a token with which the bounding
box can be removed again, see [cmd crosshair::bbox_remove] below.

[para] The bounding box [arg bbox] is specified thorugh a list of 4
values, the lower left and upper right corners of the box. The order
of values in the list is:

[example {llx lly urx ury}]

[para] Note that this command can be used multiple times, each call
adding one more bounding box. In such a case the visible area is the
[emph union] of all the specified bounding boxes.

[call [cmd crosshair::bbox_remove] [arg token]]

This command removes the bounding box specified by the [arg token] (a
result of [cmd crosshair::bbox_add]) from the crosshairs for its
canvas widget.
